\subsection{Prices and Exchanges}
Our main outcome measures are the severity of the inflation an asset price, and the magnitude of money transacted in it.
We operationalize the intensity of a bubble as the proportion of a 1 dollar (TODO check currency base) that would be lost buying at the maximum price and selling after that proportionally to the volume of the market till the present, we call this severity.
We define the volume as the sum of the contemporaneous dollar (todo check) volume of trade.
As a secondary outcome measure we consider the number of exchanges that list the coin.


\subsection{Network Structure}
TODO: EAMAN WILL WRITE THIS


We computed the following network measures for the users who introduced the
crypto coin for the first time to the forum:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{num mentions}
  \item{num posts}
  \item{num subjects}
  \item{days since first post}
  \item{degree total}
  \item{degree incoming}
  \item{degree outgoing}
  \item{clustering coefficient}
  \item{closeness centrality unweighted}
  \item{closeness centrality weighted}
  \item{closeness centrality incoming unweighted}
  \item{closeness centrality outgoing unweighted}
  \item{closeness centrality incoming weighted}
  \item{closeness centrality outgoing weighted}
  \item{betweenness centrality weighted}
  \item{satoshi distance}
  \item{satoshi pagerank weighted}
  \item{pagerank weighted}
\end{enumerate}
