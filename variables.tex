\subsection{Prices and Exchanges}
Our main outcome measures are the severity of the inflation an asset price, and the magnitude of money transacted in it.
We operationalize the intensity of a bubble as the proportion of a 1 dollar (TODO check currency base) that would be lost buying at the maximum price and selling after that proportionally to the volume of the market till the present, we call this severity.
We define the volume as the sum of the contemporaneous dollar (todo check) volume of trade.
As a secondary outcome measure we consider the number of exchanges that list the coin.


\subsection{Network Structure}
In this section, we discuss the various metrics extracted from discussion networks and used as independent variables in the regression analysis. Many of these variables are standard metrics in graph theory designed to capture node centrality is specific scenarios. As mentioned before, each coin is associated with a forum user and a discussion network which corresponds to the state of the forum at the time the user introduced the coin to the community. Below, we list the network variables included in the analysis. We used Python igraph implementation for computing the network-related metrics.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{Introducer number of posts:} The total number of posts (thread-initiations or simple replies) the coin introducer has made at the time she introduces the coin. It captures the user's level of activity in the community.
  \item{Introducer number of threads:} The total number of threads the coin introducer has made. Users who start many threads are more likely to receive incoming edges and to shape the dialogue in the community.
  \item{Seniority:} It is the number of days since the user's first post in the forums. We use this as a proxy for user's seniority in the community.
  \item{Incoming degree:} The (incoming) degree centrality captures the role of dialogue-shapers in the community as it is the number of unique users who have replied to any of the user's threads.
  \item{Outgoing degree}
  \item{Total degree}
  \item{clustering coefficient}
  \item{closeness centrality unweighted}
  \item{closeness centrality weighted}
  \item{closeness centrality incoming unweighted}
  \item{closeness centrality outgoing unweighted}
  \item{closeness centrality incoming weighted}
  \item{closeness centrality outgoing weighted}
  \item{betweenness centrality weighted}
  \item{satoshi distance}
  \item{satoshi pagerank weighted}
  \item{pagerank weighted}
\end{enumerate}
