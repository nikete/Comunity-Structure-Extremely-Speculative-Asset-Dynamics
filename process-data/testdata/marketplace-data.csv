If not please create an account and use the XDA Forum Thread after you sign up here for your apps, other services or contributions. Please remember to make a post and include your nick from this Forum.                                 We've developed a new Smart Phone OS called Æther v 0.1 Krypton. It's a unique code you will find easy and very efficient to work with. We're looking to attract quality individuals/coders who will want to be involved at the ground floor of a new game changing impervious platform unique to the korephone. This is a rare opportunity. Working with us here where it's starting will earn you an Æther ""Guru status"" since you are the first and will be the most knowledgeable. The API Reference is under development and will be posted in increments. We have a list of Apps we'd like to see first, are listed below including their Bounties and we are open to recommendations. Updates will follow as progress is made and will be often, daily to weekly. IF you have specific APPS you've developed and would like to see them on the Æther OS please advise. Please familiarize yourself with what we have up till today and check back often. Let's DO THIS!   QUESTIONS: Q: ""What language is this?” A: Details are yet to be announced. Q: “What do we export it to?” A: To be announced. Q: ""When can I start"" A: 6th December earliest.  December 12th is the official anticipated start date. Q: ""Why then for such an early thread?"" A: To line up the coders for a fast track completion of all Apps and in case we get some API references done early. Below is a GIF of the KorePhone OS running in the KorePhone Emulator. Notice the GIF's Physical Size, Quality and tiny file size. This was accomplished through the KorePhone's Æther OS v 0.1 http://i.imgur.com/LWyCO9v.gif Updates: Most recent first. ____________________________________________________________________ 4-26-15 After translating the majority of TOR over to Æther OS we decided to shelve the months worth of work. Seeing how TOR works, it's unneeded bloat, flaws and it's Achilles heel in it's exit nodes a decision was made to start from scratch. The reasoning is the same that is the drive behind the Æther OS, there has to be a better way that's more secure. This was in mind prior to translating TOR into Æther OS taking months deciphering how and why TOR works the way it does. SEE OUR STATEMENT BELOW in our last Update announcement from 3-20-15: ""It's only the first step in our security endeavors we are bringing you and want to improve the Æther OS security even beyond TOR."" Read the 1-6-15 Update as well... This has been accomplished and is in testing. ___________________________________________________________________ 3-20-15 We promised to bring you a secure OS and mentioned we were working on additional security coding. What we were working on is Translating TOR into the Æther OS which is just over 60% completed. Those aware know this is a monumental task. It's only the first step in our security endeavors we are bringing you and want to improve the Æther OS security even beyond TOR. ____________________________________________________________________ 1-30-15 We have added a huge coding task to the mix which has caused a delay in the hardware rendering and integration. Soon as this security related coding endeavor is completed the hardware rendering will commence. An update will follow when this transition happens. ____________________________________________________________________ 1-6-15 Æther OS incorporates seamless Tor and VPN privacy protections. Developers need code only with similar objects and classes they are already familiar with within the .NET/Mono API and Æther takes care of the rest; however, this is merely the first implementation of the privacy layer and more seamless protections are being planned to be added: For example, what we shall refer to at present as ""Tor 2.0"" will add additional security and privacy protections to the platform and apps running on it. NOTE: To Counteract the typical,...More than one person is in possession of the Source Code.   1-5-14 SDK UPDATE: New Release Additions: All necessary APIs required in order to write 99% of apps is now complete. + Video Input (input as webcam for emulation purposes) + Audio Output + Example app (including course code) showcases video input (as a box that can be moved around with the pointer) and audio output by audio generation when buttons are clicked. + Fully transparent Tor- and VPN-targeted classes which can be used (as alternatives) to the standard .NET implementations (e.g. AEtherSocket.) Full backend Tor and VPN infrastructure will be implemented on the device. For now the classes are there to be the methods and code building blocks by which seamless TCP security operations will take place in future, on the KOREphone. + Bug fixes Æther SDK 0.3 Installer: https://mega.co.nz/#!uRlHAaKS!Wzw8Q_0UhxMXFQN31NqnH5PMTAx1kDSpz29uKn0yeM8 All necessary APIs required in order to write 99% of apps is now complete (the exception being some games and apps that do 3D graphics.) Any extras which may be required will be added by request from any devs writing apps, of course. The hardware rendering infrastructure is next, followed by hardware integration. In the meantime devs have essentially everything they would need in order to write their apps. FYI: Attached is a summary of the OS components, it’s currently at just under 17K lines of code. That’s a lot more actual code; I’ve still yet to determine exactly how much that is but it’s easily double or triple the number. ____________________________________________________________________ 12-23-14 Combined and updated SINGLE DOWNLOAD Link:   https://mega.co.nz/#!GI1H3IyI!v1GY3jSKnIkJfmQQV7bWEjwYNDL5pz7jUNMXu5P0Mlg ""I've made an installer, which takes care of stuff like adding assemblies to the GAC (so you don't need to do it manually).

31,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=716331.0,7,3791,smooth,"The fundamental reason large traders want to find each other and trade blocks (in every market) is to avoid front running (perhaps this is what you mean by manipulation). Let's say you want to buy 50k XMR so you start buying on an exchange, but with the liquidity there you can only buy a few thousand per day without moving the price much. Other people start seeing there is a big buyer in the market and bid the price up ahead of you. Now it costs you more to complete the trade. The same thing happens to the seller, especially if he isn't selling at the same time you are buying (and since you don't really know about each other, how would you communicate?). Let's say you buy this week and he sells next week -- in that case you will both get worse executions. There is also the fact that trying to buy 50K on an exchange without absurd slippage might be a lot of work.

He spent last few days researching and going into town to get a fairly large UPS and a 102ah Battery giving him a considerable amount of time. Well over 6 hours backup. The release date for the API's, SDK and Documentation is the 15th. Soon as these are released the app coders can all get started and we can move onto hardware integration. Though they could have it finished in next few days he's going to wire that set up for when the power goes out. Better to have a date they could easily make.

(r,g,b, a ) Also, I have noticed that you have put up some generous bounties for software that can be built within minutes. Why? Sorry, but you claim to have more or less built an NSA hack-proof (if I may call it that) OS yet you are offering generous bounties for something very simple. (Obviously promotion is a major part here, I can understand that). Shouldn't your team be offering bounties for replacements of software of the likes of TOR (which have been back-doored ages ago?)? Now, that being said, I can probably build all of what you are seeking but I couldn't care less for any of them rather than #20 (besides, there should be many people involved in this). Which is still a very vague description of your requirement. Are you looking to have another ""snake"" or ""tetris"" game? Or do you want a game with balls (testicles in this case)? If you want a game with balls then you NEED to ATLEAST provide support for the Flash Platform. Once you do that thousands of already existing titles can be deployed to your platform, much like whats is happening now.

4,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=919473.0,17,295,politzer,"During past week I was monitoring 4 coins which had received de-listing warning from Bittrex because of their low trade volume. Esportscoin, Ghostcoin, Whistlecoin and Apex. They were supposed to be de-listed on January 9th. Apex could hit the minimum trade volume in last day of deadline and survived. The total trade volume of Esportscoin was around 1.30 - 1.35 btc and it only needed 0.05-0.1 btc to survive but it couldn't. So Bittrex de-listed it today. Same scenario happened to Ghostcoin too. But something strange happened for the Whistlecoin for the second time during past 2 weeks. Its trade volume for the whole week was less than 0.2 btc (almost 0.02 btc per day) but Bittrex has not de-listed it for the second time. Whistle was supposed to be de-listed on January 2ed too as many coins were removed i that time. Because its volume was less than minimum average. But they did not de-list it on January 2ed and surprisingly they extended its warning for another week. And now they have not de-listed it again.

Background: SpreadCoin Ann: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=715435.0 Basically SpreadCoin was made so that no pools could mine it; solo-mining only. You must download SpreadCoin's wallet, SpreadCoin's GPU and update your GPU driver (if AMD) to 14.9 and then you must tweak the .conf file to allow mining to the wallet. Right now SpreadCoin is flying under the radar and due to price appreciation and extremely low difficulty is the single most profitable cryptocurrency to mine however due to pools not being able to mine SpreadCoin, Betarigs renting won't work on SpreadCoin, nor do any of the other mining rental sites. So I am forced to come here and am willing to pay a mega-rig owner 0.50 BTC/Gh/Day to mine SpreadCoin for my wallet. So for example if you have a 200 mh/s X11 rig I will pay you 0.10 BTC per day to mine for me. This is more than double what current X11 rigs are being rented for on Betarigs right now ( https://www.betarigs.com/list?miner_type=5&rig_size=2%2C3%2C4%2C5&rent_duration=3%2C6%2C12%2C24%2C48%2C72%2C168%2C336&support=0&quality=0 ) I will help you with all setup and will pay you by the hour starting one hour after startup to make sure everything's working okay.

All that would be required of this position would be the ability to help in windows QT wallet compilation of our altcoin. A good understanding of C++ is preferred, but not absolutely essential, provided the applicant has enough knowledge to compile windows QT wallets. This position is to pass on that knowledge, so again, payment would be dependent on the applicant's ability to successfully replicate their success with a highly competent member of our team. The applicant will also need experience with the GitHub repository. The developer who wishes to join our team would receive a monthly stake of PMP along with the other developers. The stake amount would be decided upon based on experience and what they're able to bring to the table. The developer who wishes to take on a short-term role of showing one of our developers how to compile QT wallets may receive a one-time stake of PMP, or a small one-time payment of 0.1 BTC, or a combination of the two. Payment will be made only if the applicant is successful in teaching our team member to compile the QT wallet.

I'd ask that before you consider leaving negative trust, read the thread. If you really don't want to read the important information below, then here's what you 100% need to know: We're an on-the-blockchain dogecoin ponzi with a tiny 1% fee. Deposit to DMM1ZhcDMPwuE2AAjTDhCFVXvtnUkoSfkR Check on progress at https://dogechain.info/address/DMM1ZhcDMPwuE2AAjTDhCFVXvtnUkoSfkR Receive back 120% of your deposit within 15 minutes of there being available funds If you need support or you happen to encounter an issue, send me a PM on Bitcointalk Minimum deposit is a meagre 1000 dogecoin (you can try virtually risk-free!), any less and you won't be repaid Features 120% return on your investment Payment scheduled every 15 minutes No ""rounds"" - the script is setup and ready to go and will stay forever Everything is on the blockchain - no website, for the convenience Frequently Asked Questions What do you gain from this? : I am charging a ridiculously low 1% fee. I'm sure there's not a lower fee in ponzi land. This is my first time doing something like this, and I want it to be more for the benefit of others than myself. Why trust me? : The reason I am running this is to build up trust for myself here. I have an upcoming, much larger gambling site on the horizon and I'd like for people here to be able to trust me before I roll that site out. What makes this different to other ponzis? : I'll be 100%, completely honest with you . Aside from the fact that this is using dogecoin instead of the regular bitcoin ponzis, nothing is different aside from the fact that we'll never stop, we'll never scam, and we'll ALWAYS have just a 1% fee. What is the minimum investment? : Just to make things clear, the minimum investment is just 1000 dogecoin. This means you can try the program pratically risk free! Anything deposited below 1000 dogecoin will be ignored and won't be repaid. When will I be repaid? : Payments are repaid in order they're received. When you're top of the queue, as soon as there is 121% of your deposit in the wallet, you'll receive your coin within 15 minutes. Payments are setup to be sent out every 15 minutes. Why no website? : I know the basics of website development, nothing too much. I didn't want to pay someone to create this, as that would've led to me charging a higher fee to recoup my investment. Everything takes place blockchain side and my program is setup correctly to payout automatically, everything has been tested. How long till I'm repaid? : Check the blockchain and do some basic maths to find out. You get repaid 120% and I take a tiny 1% fee. Voila! Anything else I need to know? : Not really! Everything takes place on the blockchain, so you can ensure we're not ripping you off or removing funds by visiting our address: https://dogechain.info/address/DMM1ZhcDMPwuE2AAjTDhCFVXvtnUkoSfkR Please post if you have any questions or want to know anything!

Totally unnecessary high resolution that you didn't ask for: Actual Size: I'd also like to recommend, and I mean no offence to you. But perhaps investing into a image or branding may be something your company should look at. As well as actually paying someone to do your advertisement banners. Also, I'd like to point out how awful these competitions are. Imagine if your looking for work, and someone says ""Hey everyone, if you come in and work today, at the end of the week we'll decide who's worked the best, and we'll pay him his fair wage. The rest of you, thanks for coming in."". It's really not fair. And I hate to be that guy, but graphics design and company imaging is just as important as the actual company itself. Much like how you'd wear a dress suit in presentation. Your company's branding is extremely important. I just want to say, if I do win this bounty, I will be sharing it fairly with every single person who's made a real submission.

People seem more interested in an organized trading group, on top of my advice, which I am still down to give, but long term trading groups are great too. To grow the crew, I will accept the first 7 people with enough liquid BTC to pass my judgment in for free . After that it is a 1.0 BTC lifetime fee. After the 7 slots are filled there will be a 1.0 BTC lifetime fee which allows you to be eligible to enter a dedicated, professional and organized group. We will have goals, targets and support coins that deserve it. We also will be helping each other through giving advice, getting to know one another, as well as teaching some technical analysis. We will use either Skype on 24/7 (or IRC chat) for more instant communication and I will create a forum for posting and new moves to all members. ~~~ 7/7 slots filled Free Slots Closed ~~~ PM if interested.

I'm not happy with them, so bringing the total back to 160 shares as I don't want to deploy any more of these things. We promised a Srcypt group buy; but the power consumption on GPUs really hurts the profitability over time.  Enter Gridseed, the first combo Sha256/Scrypt ASIC. I've placed the order for 48Mhash worth of Gridseed Asics - QTY 8 of LA6M. If you aren't a current owner there are a few owners that are looking to sell some of their shares of earlier group buys, I will help facilitate your purchase. I think there are some offered at .25btc. Or PM me for interesting offers, we're still trying to grow the community and don't want people being left out. Owners only, limit 1 per share you own .  0.55 BTC gets you 300kh/s of Scrypt hashrate hosted FREE as long as you maintain your other group buy shares in good standing.  If you take delivery of hardware for your other shares and want to keep the 300kh/s of Scrypt, a $14.99 per month fee per share of Group Buy #5 will apply.  We don't have an exact start date yet, but expect to be hashing no later than Feb 28th.   Asiabtc has guaranteed shipping by Feb 20th, and promises a full refund if not shipped.  If they fail to deliver, any refund we obtain will be dispersed back to the owners.  We've done due diligence and asiabtc has been reputable, but we can not assume responsibility in the case where they fail to refund or deliver. Who am I? I'm an open source developer, and a Bitcoin mining hardware addict. I've run out space at several mining locations, and finally ""bit the bullet"" and moved into a world class datacenter. We are talking about a 24 hour security (multiple redundant power systems, back-up generators, back-up back-up generators, pre-chilled water tanks for back-up cooling, retina-scan access) professional data center. I am the Meetup coordinator for the Arizona Bitcoin Meetup group (now 110+ members strong; Bitcoin is kicking ass in PHX!!!). I've met many people from Bitcointalk and prominent members of the community in person as well. I've run a few Bitcoin related projects, designed my own Bitfury USB miner (ouch on that story), and pretty much eat, sleep, drink, live and breathe Bitcoin 24/7/365. A full-time employee at the datacenter is a group buy owner. Our hardware is getting the coldest spot in the house, and will be well supervised! No more intense heat, fire risk, angry wife, or surprise electric bills. Let us host your miner(s) in an ICE COLD datacenter. This Group Buy Includes: 8 Gridseed LA6M Units Free Hosting as long as you as long as you maintain your other group buy shares in good standing. Terms Payouts will be paid weekly. Hosting is FREE as long as you maintain your other group buy shares in good standing.  If you take delivery of hardware for your other shares and want to keep the 300kh/s of Scrypt, a $14.99 per month fee per share of Group Buy #5 will apply. As these units share a common control module, it's not possible to take physical delivery.  We expect to run these units for several years. Non-payment of hosting fees/deficit will result in forfeiture of ownership rights to the hosted hardware. Any and all payments are due when invoiced; 30 days late constitutes default and will result in forfeiture of your fractional ownership. How to Buy Current owners only send BTC 0.55 x the number of shares you would like to the common group buy payment address: 1NiNJAGi1k51pfxKsQQQisf3MMwsPU5yCc ACH Payments available on request via PM, at the preev.com rate.   FINCEN Compliance: This group buy is hosted in the US and geared toward US persons who would like to take an ownership position of Bitcoin mining hardware. You are buying a fractional ownership of the hardware. The group buy coordinator is NOT offering any type of security or financial product, rather we are selling fractional ownership of physical hardware and providing hosting/management services.

It was created on the 17th May 2014 by jl777 (an active and respected member of the community and creator of SuperNET). From the beginning, jl777 has been including in the portfolio a proportion of his new ventures (5-10%) and some of the Assets he receives from promising companies. The intention isn’t to trade the assets, but instead to hold them in the portfolio for ever (or almost…). Except in rare and special case, no Assets will be sold. Some of the revenue generated by the portfolio's assets in 2014 was invested in the acquisition of new Assets. But the main part of the portfolio consists of assets which have been added by jl777. You can see the actual composition of the portfolio in real time on the Nxt blockchain on the account NXT-2AHU-UXZW-K9Q2-HENLW. The jl777hodl Asset The ownership of the JLH portfolio is shared between the owners of JLH Assets. There are 10’000’000 JLH ( Asset ID 6932037131189568014 ). This means that 1 JLH represents 1 in 10’000’000 of the portfolio. The goal of JLH JLH is a promising portfolio which covers the most interesting Nxt projects that have been created since the Asset Exchange launched. Such a portfolio should generate a lot of investor interest. In his projects, especially for the Asset/Asset exchange InstantDEX , jl777 needs a stable Asset with a big volume of transactions. JLH, because of its varied and promising portfolio, is perfect for jl777’s projects. JLH is an important financial tool which provides a valuation reference for InstantDEX and the Asset trading tools created by jl777 for SuperNET . Revenue and holder’s reward The jl777 portfolio has two sources of NXT revenue:  the dividends it receives from its Assets and forging revenue . In 2014, this revenue was invested in new Assets and to organise some events to increase the transaction volume. SinceJanuary 2015, the revenue will be partly distributed to the JLH holders as a bonus. A big part will go to the holders and the rest will be used for JLH management and promotion. NAV and market maker The NET Asset Value (NAV) is the basis of valuation of the JLH asset. The NAV per share is calculated by dividing the total value of the portfolio by the number of the shares (10’000’000). You can find a good estimation of the portfolio's value on Nxtreporting. As the value of JLH's underlying assets increase, so does the value of each individual share. Sometimes, however, the share price doesn't always reflect it's actual NAV (Net Asset Value). In late 2014, jl tasked LibertyNow to act as a ""market maker"" in order to keep the share prices closer to NAV by increasing liquidity and market visibility. LibertyNow makes his own calculation of the JLH asset's NAV. He bases his calculation on an average of the last trade price/high bid price/low ask price. It’s a little different from Nxtreporting which only uses the last trade price. The JLH team jl777 (James): founder and manager of the portfolio. LibertyNow: market maker.

If you use windows, follow the instructions at this post . 11/19/14 - I just fixed a crashing bug that comes from session termination when a user logs out of the bot account in a browser. This happens when the bot is running and the user logs into the bot account in a browser then logs out of the browser session by closing the browser or otherwise purposefully logging out. The bot will now recognize the situation and recover. Also, getting started in windows is now much easier. Check this post . Introduction Let's face it, bitcointalk has become overrun with trolls. On bitcoin talk, you could begin a thread dedicated to your love of your grandmother and in 5 minutes it would be crawling with trolls calling your own heartfelt feelings a scam, or worse. Of course by using the self moderation option when you create a thread, you can go through and laboriously delete each troll post manually. It's very gratifying but also a lot of work. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a bot that could do this for you? Well now there is. Introducing XSTerminate: a bitcointalk deletebot to rid unwanted visitors from your threads. Using XSTerminate is easy. Just edit the config file according to your user name, password, topic number (found in the thread URL), and a couple of other settings. Then fill in your blacklist, which I like to call the ""luser"" list. Then, fire up XSTerminate, pointing it to your config file. And, like magic, you will have peace of mind. You can go to sleep knowing that the troll you despise is not going to come back without making a newbie account. And if he does, you can blacklist that account too! You wouldn't even have to restart XSTerminate either. Just edit the luser list and let XSTerminate take care of the rest. To get started, you can download the XSTerminate program and example files here: https://github.com/deletebot/XSTerminate/archive/master.zip Or, you can go to github and clone the XSTerminate repository at https://github.com/deletebot/XSTerminate The contents of the README.md file are below.

XSTerminate is a python program with only two dependencies: pyyaml and BeautifulSoup. XSTerminate can run as a daemon in *nix systems or as a console program in both Windows (NT+) and *nix systems. In *nix it can be killed with SIGINT (ctrl-C in the console) or SIGTERM in Windows. In such cases, it will terminate gracefully and save cookie information. Usage Code: xsterminate deletebot.yml The file ""deletebot.yml"" is a yaml file with several settings. Configuration user: the bitcointalk username password: the bitcointalk password (remove or make null for getpass) topic: the bitcointalk topic number found in the topic url lusers: the luser blacklist with one luser name per line activity: users must have this minimal activity to post sleep: be nice to bitcointalk by sleeping between thread reloads cookiefile: the file wherein cookies are stored debug: prints debug output if set to true; omit or set to false if unwanted The settings ""activity"", ""sleep"", and ""debug"" can be changed in the config file while the bot is live and the bot will adjust its behavior upon the next reload of the thread messages. Example Config File: ""deletebot.yml"" Code: # user name at BCT user : deletebot # remove or make null for getpass; put in a password for auto password : null # BCT topic number topic : 850210 # file with username blacklist, one per line lusers : lusers.txt # minimum activity a user needs to post # see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=444292 # can be modified while bot is live activity : 5 # sleep this many seconds before reloading new messages # can be modified while bot is live sleep : 60 # name of the file where cookies are stored cookiefile : cookies.lwp # for development, this can be ommitted or set to false # can be modified while bot is live debug : true Example Blacklist File: ""lusers.txt"" Code: Luser1 Luser2 Luser3",717,Newbie,deletebot,07:41:13,2014-11-07,22,623,1,XSTerminate: A bitcointalk deletebot to rid unwanted visitors from your threads.

Go create your own thread with your own work and then post your rants there once your product drives an audience. You'll see that no one stops you. That's free speech. In fact, fork my product if you don't have time to develop your own. It's open source with a very permissive license.

I suggested a community blacklist and did not offer any accounts for the luser list. I singled out no users anywhere. Except for my bias towards XST, I don't show any bias here.

3,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=923656.0,16,573,Freebieservers,"When FreebieServers.com first launched, we had a single virtual machine and an idea:  to bring the Freemium business model to the Game Server world, and in the process provide a free gaming platform for users to grow and cultivate a community.  We started using a host of third-party applications to help us realize this idea, and while it had been a difficult job getting the different systems to work together, we’ve gotten our software to a point that works - in its own way. Once we started seeing that our idea was not only popular but made a good business model, we realized that these tools were not enough to help our business grow in a way that was not only easy to manage from our viewpoint, but easy to handle from our client’s viewpoint as well.  Knowing that in the Freemium model presentation is a large part of success, we decided to start development our own tools to take FreebieServers.com into the next generation of game serving, and that meant replacing these third-party tools that we use to manage and govern our systems.          Two months ago, around the beginning of November 2014, we began fundraising for development of these new tools.  Small loans for specific projects evolved into crowdfunding from the NXT Community Marketing Committee, and this has allowed us to begin development of our own systems to replace these third party programs.  The primary third-party software we use, GameCP, has been a huge help in providing the platform to actually serve game servers to our clients.  This tool was not designed with our business model in mind however, and thus has been the focus of the majority of our development:  a replacement for GameCP that can give us all the tools necessary to provide game servers with our Freemium business model in mind.          Due directly to the investment from the NXT community, we have managed to develop a system as robust as GameCP in a fraction of GameCP’s development time - 2 months versus 10 years - and this has allowed us to customize how we provide game servers to our clients and implement the first ever micro-transaction-based business model in the game server industry.  This also allows us to present our goods with a direct connection to advertising partners and the NXT community, ensuring global spread and delivery of meaningful content. Freebieservers Our new game server panel allows us to not only provide free game servers reliably and consistently (a feature that GameCP found lacking at times due to our unique model), but also allows us to provide an actual value to our goods using a cryptocurrency - NXTCoin.  This symbiotic partnership we have cultivated not only allows us to accept many different currencies beyond the USD, but also helps spread the value of NXTCoin specifically and cryptocurriencies as a whole, by using them as our primary virtual currency system.  Other Freemium business models (most commonly Free-to-Play video games) utilize this virtual currency system to value their goods within their own system, instead we use an actual currency giving our target demographic of over 14 million gamers worldwide a direct correlation between the value of their virtual goods and a cryptocurrency. Now that our new panel is able to provide reliable game serving to our clients, our goals for the near future are to provide intelligent advertising solutions to bring a consistent revenue stream to speed development of our infrastructure.  As part of our new system, we can ensure delivery of advertisement content to our users in a meaningful way thanks to in-game MOTD advertisements served by way of custom plugins and in-site modal popups with advanced regional-based offers. The combination of these technologies allows us to provide premium Tier 1 advertisement hits to any affiliate partners, the track record of which has already been proven via such services as Pinion.gg and MyNXT.info.  Users who sign up for our services are more likely to adopt the product that we advertise due to the targeted methods we use to serve and enforce ads. In the near future, our infrastructure expansion will likely involve a cloud solution giving us the ability to server game servers all over the world.  Our current model does not provide the elasticity we need to serve game servers around the world, and directly impacts our advertisement delivery.   To that end, one of the major expenses in the coming future is the shift from bare metal to cloud, which is overall a more expensive solution, but has a greater potential for growth overall.  By making direct partnerships with various advertising solutions, we can provide consistent and intelligent marketing to users all over the world via direct in-game MOTD video and banner ads, CPL signups delivered via modal popups on our website, and any other method we can craft into our system without presenting it in a manner that will drive users away. We plan on a number of additional revenue streams to maximize our growth potential, including licensing of our new panel software for others to use, creating a commodity-based virtual goods betting system, and the introduction of the first-ever gamer related cryptocurrency - backed by NXTCoin.  The diversification of these revenue streams ensures the long-term viability of our business model and the meaningful spread of cryptocurrency to a market more than willing to utilize it in a way that increases the value overall.

Our users were requested to sign ups and do a variety of activities to garner an ad-free server and some free nxt coins. Over the past 40 days we’ve delivered 3000 sign ups , averaging 100 sign ups every day. From an advertiser perspective, this is major number that can be actively utilized for monetizing and educating users about what we offer   1.2 In-server video’s        We have a combined capacity of delivering over 500,000 impressions every month on our servers between multiple game sessions held while a user is on our server. We intend to form partnership with a variety of coins/communities to help further spread details about what the tech offers and why its important   1.3 Banner ads.        We are able to deliver multiple banner ads between game sessions and on-site to users from across the globe with minimal interruptions to gamers. As long as the product relates to what the users require / the demographic relates to what mentoned, we’ve seen a reasonably high level of interest spurt out of the variety of banner ads we’ve displayed in the past ad we intend to tap on this to further move ahead The following are 3 places we strongly see Nxt being integrated     Game item exchanges. In order to further bring in added revenue to the company, we are actively looking at making an exchange for the trade and exchange of game items. Users will be allowed to sell/purchase game items at under-market rates from our exchange utilizing Nxt. How does Nxt come in the picture? Most pay processing companies charge high rates for micro-transactions. Utilizing the speed and low transaction rates Nxt utilizes we’ll be able to tap on to the wide market that lies for game items. Think of it this way : How much will nxt benefit if we see atleast a fraction of the billion dollar industry that deals with game items moving into our platform and have them utilize Nxt?     Gambling + Game items ? We intend to roll out an -in-house gambling platform that focuses on game items. Game items are commodity and can often be traded for actual currency. We intend to develop a gambling platform that enables players to bet game items and either cash it out into nxt or just have game items sent back to them. We have this at the top of our priority list and will be rolling this out as soon as our current panel is shipped succesfully. Transactional volumes will be large enough to add value to the network. I’ll be willing to share further details on this with the admins, but would prefer to refrain posting much information on this - given its sensitive nature.   http://   Gamer team sponsorships.   Over the past month we’ve had a number of globally ranked teams reaching out to us, looking forward to working with us on FS promotions. We intend to have  nxt and FS logo imprinted on their jerseys as they move ahead with their career. FS will be promoting gamer merchandise and servers required for them to trade. This helps us establish ourselves as an emerging platform and put word out there. Think of the impact the Nascar campaign had on the value of Doge? Imagine we could pull that out for Nxt every other week? That’s exactly what we intend to do for nxt with our partnership with high end gamers from across the globe. I’ll be very willing to share conversations with a number of globally ranked players with a total reach that cross over half a million users with the admins here. We are raising funds for the same cause. We intend to work with a variety of crypto's and anyone is welcome for a collaboration with what we're trying to build. If you'd like to donate to our cause you may send us coins to the following wallets Nxt : NXT-8MLD-T9Q8-NE6E-53MSM Btc:  193bgtfvAE7PAksacWUaGKKPw9thuV8jsn",793,Newbie,Freebieservers,14:20:54,2015-01-13,2,616,1,Marketing Proposition from Freebieservers.com

299,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=453536.260,16,17561,MWNinja,"Multipool Scrypt I'd go for: 1. Nicehash (with diff set at 256) (with minimum payout to the payout on LTC * 1,2) 2. Clevermining (with diff set at 256) For SHA256 I'd go for this: 1. Nicehash (with minimum payout to the ""average"" payout on 1 Th in BTC * 1,05) 2. GHash.io Since you're in the US you'd be better off with WestHash I think, same system. Minimum payout refers to the payout per hash that the market at that point gives, if it drops under that it kicks your miner off and lets it drop to the failover pool. Once the payout pops up above your set minimum you'll be mining nicehash again automatically. Regarding the average payout on BTC, I fill in 1 Th here: https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty (atm 0.02109) so you'd end up with a minimum wanted payout of 0,0221445 BTC per Th/day. LTC same thing, Nicehash pops up and down a bit throughout the day, I keep my miners there when it's about 110/120% above regular LTC levels. I on average update those minimum levels every week to one and a half week, at least when there is a BTC difficulty change or a bit jump with LTC.

The batch 8 S3+ went up on Bitmain for .58 BTC each (that is under $300) and hashes at 453 GH/s... buying BTC with that $1500 and then buying 5 S3+ will be adding 2.265 TH/s minimum by Sept 20th. That earns at least half the BTC cost back by the end of the year on a steady 20% increase through the end of the year. these S3s will be profitable well into 2015 and possibly later and represent one hell of a way to ensure this GB continues to make BTC.

So we would be mainly hitting LTC through pools and LTC looks to be crumbling. In October all large Scrypt ASIC builders will have delivered. The Gridseeds we have will be completely useless by then and I would like to get at least ONE of the ninja GB's I'm in to ROI or at least get close to it. GAW absolutely sucks powerwise. Even their new Green line does. So for me Scrypt isn't a real option to invest in right now. I've done calculations on all available hardware and even with mild increases they don't ROI. I don't think it's such a problem to switch to SHA256 since we're already paying out in BTC anyway and while we try to sell off more gridseeds at least we're getting a hell of a lot of revenue coming in from the Ant's. With a budget of 1500 USD I think that's the best way to earn back most of the investment and make a profit on top. Plus I'd like to get more discussion in the group and decisions by the members. There's been a whole load of messages before we got a response from MWNinja with a statusupdate, I'd like to get a bit more engagement from the GB manager. We've been sitting on that 1500 USD since 23rd of June and no action there. It's the groups money and the group needs to decide what to do with it. Same thing with the switch to GHash multipool. That's a decision the group should make or at least get involved in. Yup, it makes life easier with payouts but like I said, they orphan like hell there, I had to unselect most of the smaller coins there in my fallover pool. I'd rather have them pointed at Nicehash when the price there is higher than elsewhere (or the ninjacloud if that works well) and with CM as first pool and maybe GHash as failover.

After PMing with MWNinja, the information displayed in the ""Total BTC Paid"" field for GB5 (which is what I scrape) comes from the API of the mining pool. So far, so good. Unfortunately, several pools have been tried at first in search of maximizing income, and the revenue from other pools isn't included in that field. That's why you are seeing negative incremental income, since the ""Total Earnings"" field in the weekly field includes all income. MWNinja suggested incorporating the info from the blockchain into my calculation (via json output from https://blockchain.info/address/1B5HnZQBAUx4TRWE9rN3jrF7up9Rs49iyi ). That is (of course) quite possible, but my scraping code does not deal with that at present. Let me see what I can do but no promises. (This is a volunteer effort, after all.

My understanding from other posts thus far is people are struggling with your hang up issue because the included hub is shit... SHIT. Apparently... it may not be providing enough STABLE power and when one device goes out, the whole hub has to be restarted. I DID experience something like this in my initial testing playing with the miner applications... the USB must be unplugged and plugged back in (or power cycled) in order for the miner to be picked up again... this arose when I was playing with frequencies to get the best rate. The reason you have to power cycle the HUB is that the board itself on each device draws ZERO power from the PSU itself... the damn things will mine on USB power alone so any fluctuation in temp and hashrate can cause a power spike... overdrawing on the hub... causing the hub to fail and require the disconnect and reconnect of the device before hashing will start. Some have chosen much higher quality hubs with better peak power performance which seems to resolve these issues. So far since I found my best settings... I was dual mining on Win 7 64 bit with my unit... zero hang ups... 7 GH/s SHA256 and 330 KH/s scrypt. I do not have this on my KILL-A-WATT yet but when I get up in the AM and find I have had no stability issues with the cgminer 3.7.2 for scrypt, I will start them again on it to get a power draw in dual mode. Dual requires one cgminer 3.8.5 miner for SHA256 and then a second minerd launched with the --dual flag for scrypt. FYI I was able to push mine to 1000 clock in cgminer but didn't like how slowly shares came in... 900 settled back to a good rate and has me at 383 KH/s in cgminer. These little work horses have a TON of headroom... the firmware is sadly very flimsy and can't handle the big guns yet... time will tell if we can double their performance.",988,Hero Member,daemonfox,05:39:58,2014-03-06,532,629,9,[CLOSED] Ninja Group Buy #5 - QTY 8 Gridseed LA6M 48Mhash Scrypt [0/160]

299,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=453536.160,16,17561,MWNinja,"I now have one LightningAsic with TP-Link, and two ""generic"" sets with the wiibox. Both controllers are crap, but the TP-Link at least works and is in English, I couldn't get the wiibox work at all. Eventually I hooked up the ""generic"" sets to a PC and I'm using cpuminer (can't get cgminer to work with Windows COM ports, will try Linux later). Anyway, I can now compare TP-Link vs. computer-attached solution. TP-Link has a decent UI (with some minor quirks) with quick status/hashrate overview. That's pretty much where it's advantage ends. It restarts miners every 1-2 hours on wafflepool (~330Kh/s per miner avg), and is almost unusable on clevermining or middlecoin (restarts every 10-20 minutes). If you try to connect more than 10 miners to the box it is restarting miners more often and it also seems to become less responsive, just not powerful enough I guess. Cpuminer on Windows lacks hashrate stats and I need to run a separate cmd window for each miner, so it's a bit of a hassle (cgminer would be better). However the miners now are running stable for nearly 24 hours at ~340 Kh/s on clevermining, 2% reject rate. Handling 20 miners was not an issue, zero CPU usage on a cheap Celeron, just a few megs of RAM per instance of cpuminer, so it can certainly handle a lot more than that. My next step will be to test it with Raspberry + cgminer + a relay to toggle USB hub power remotely (optional - if the next few days show it to be necessary).",990,Hero Member,suchmoon,17:37:29,2014-03-06,532,629,9,[CLOSED] Ninja Group Buy #5 - QTY 8 Gridseed LA6M 48Mhash Scrypt [0/160]

This looks great and I can add it to my Pi distro.  I only have a couple of Pi's though, so we will need to order some more of them.

299,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=453536.160,16,17561,MWNinja,Problem with Raspberry is that it can only go 2 hubs down and that it doesn't do well with usb 3.0. Have 22 on one now but so far except for one that doesn't send shares it's looking well. I've ordered better hubs from china and expect them next week. Currently fixing my last set of 10 and see whether I can get the Pi up to 32 with my setup. It doesn't work well with hotplugging 10 at a time though I've ordered two more Pi's and that should fix most of the problems,995,Hero Member,Flep182,16:05:54,2014-03-08,546,629,9,[CLOSED] Ninja Group Buy #5 - QTY 8 Gridseed LA6M 48Mhash Scrypt [0/160]
