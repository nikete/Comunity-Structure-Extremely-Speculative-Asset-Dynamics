You might get better performance and/or lower power usage, since it has only 8 MB of cache. Even if the hash rate drops a bit you might check power usage and find it more efficient (if you care about that). Regarding the poll, the best price performance is probably used server gear (Xeon's) if you can get it at a good price and without paying for a lot of extra stuff (drives, RAM, etc.) that you don't need, although in theory you can sell that stuff off (more work).",14,Hero Member,smooth,09:50:07,2015-05-04,728,160,1,[XMR] What Hardware and Software do you use to mine the MONERO XMR

I have 6x XFX 7970s on a Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 with both x1 slots pin shorted. I have tried 14.4 (moded inf files), 14.6 may 23 (app), and 14.7 july 9 (app). What happens is I either get code 43 on 1 out of 6 gpu's (it's a different gpu with each catalyst version), or my computer instantly shuts down between the windows logo screen and the Welcome screen, until I do a cold reboot, then I get code 43. I think it may be a Windows problem because I'm able to run BAMT on this rig with the 14.6 linux drivers (though I only get HW errors because I can't figure out how to install sgminer in linux properly).

The problem is that 'code 43' occurs not only when driver are not configured properly(this scenario is solved by mod), but also when something else is wrong.. Whats the revision of your 990fxa-ud3? I'm running 6x290 on x1 risers on 990fxa-ud3 rev:3.0. However I helped a guy setup 6x290 with same mobo but 4.0 revision and it din't work. Nor in Windows nor in BAMT nor in xUbuntu. Windows reported code 43, *nix hanged on boot. So there is something wrong with this mobo prly. The issue was solved by swapping one 290 with 7950.. Also, that 6x290 on 990fxa-ud3 refused to boot at all headless untill I set ""Full Screen LOGO Show"" to ""Enabled"" in BIOS - very odd.

I checked the box for Modify Registry and ran the app, restarted the machine and still had one of the cards showing a 43 error code.  I then checked the box for Modify Registry and Force, ran the app and also merged the reg file manually then restarted and all cards were working.  I should have restarted first without merging the reg file to test properly but it had been a long day so sorry for the poor testing there. Headless, I was running windows 7 x64 with 6x Sapphire Tri-x 290's and mining Monero but kept getting lockups with any of Claymore's miners past 3.4 so I decided to give windows 8.1 a try.  I have four of these rigs but testing on two of them, if I remove the monitor and then teamviewer in, all I get is a black screen.  This issue was present before the mod and I have read a few people stating the exact same thing - http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoinmining/comments/1wdawz/headless_windows_81_290x/ - With windows 7 I was restricted to a 640x480 teamviewer window, but at least I could see the desktop and there was just enough space to use the machine, windows 8.1 I get nothing.  I have ordered a few of these - http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00C9UB9OK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 - as the cards only have dvi-d, hdmi and display port and all of the dvi converters I have are dvi-i > vga.  Fingers crossed.",144,Member,MrJay,07:30:45,2014-07-29,115,677,1,7xGPU + Windows // modding AMD video driver is the answer

I just tried 13.12 with the same results. Both the rigs with 6 gpu's run rev 4.0 of the 990FXA-UD3. One works one doesn't. I've tried swapping in a 7950, but that didn't help. I've been properly cleaning up the drivers with one of your old instruction sets. Aside from the type of GPU's, there are only 3 other differences in the rigs: (1) this rig has 4gb of ram; the working one has 8; (2) This one has dual identical 1000 watt psu's; the working one is a single 1250 watt psu; and (3) this one is running Windows 7 Home Premium installed and activated by the previous owner; the working one is running windows 8.1. I'm thinking the last bit is the most important. Since Linux works, I really don't think it is a hardware issue. I'm going to try and borrow a hard drive and put a clean windows 8.1 install and the 14.6 may 23 drivers and will report back.

The truth is out there ; ) Ah, btw, if you have display plugged in, make sure that BIOS is visible at boot if not plug it into different card until you see it.

I am running CGMiner 3.7.x and only want to mine Scrypt/Litecoin. I'm using Wafflepool but have tried ghash as well. I can get one going just fine, I can sometimes add a second miner and both will show 370.0 hashrate or higher fluctuating. But only 1 of them will show WU: (worker upload?). This is running off one PC, I've tried through mutiple individual power supplies, and using a splitter. I've tried with a USB hub a,d directly connecting to the PC USB ports. Doesn't matter how many I hook up, it will show a hashrate, but only one gets the ""WU:"" numbers and only that one shows accepted shares. Now if I go to another pc/laptop on the same network in my house and hook one up, the same behavior happens. Perhaps its because I'm using cgminer? or perhaps it is a network traffic thing? any ideas guys?",178,Jr. Member,DickyDck,17:21:46,2014-09-22,54,674,1,Cannot seem to run multiple GridSeed Asic miners from one machine

Another question - is such data rate between FPGAs possible at all? Well, data transfer doesn't need to be 100% reliable, implementing some error correction code shouldn't take too much LUTs, hashing engine and i/o can sit on different clocks, looks like there are enough diffio pairs in top LX150 variants.

My question is simple: Is this even possible ? and how would work such asic. I mean from my understanding of asic, an asic is designed for one task only (and between x11 and x15 there is 4 different algos). How would that be possible ? What could be the speed on individual algo such as groestl simd etc ? (at some point make me wonder why they don't release an asic doing every algo in the chain   they would own every coin   ) It would be good to have some answer from expert in asic/fpga field (cleverhash people are also welcome, may-be they will answer...)

17,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=843940.0,17,2540,djm34,"actually what people seem to disregard is the link between the rise of x11 hashrate and srypt asics. It seems obvious at least to me that many moved away their gpu farm from scrypt and started to mine any x11 crap around... Did a few x11 coin launch, there was right away from the start several GH/s... now that might plead for x11 fpga... but the same behavior was seen on second x15 coin  (which was launched only a couple of day after the gpu algo had been released... ) and it couldn't have been fpga because of the timing (as they were not present on first x15 coin and I don't think fpga dev need to wait for the gpu code to get released before running...   ) Also same behavior of freshcoin/algo; same behavior on Nist algo.... and if you look carefully to what it is pointing you will see hash renting company (and investor/non-miner joining in through that) and not fpga. So basically the ""fpga rumor"" was created, in my opinion, mostly as fud and/or to counteract against people moving away from scrypt... (probably also against the infamous thread asking ltc to change to x11 algo) (I don't have anything against chinese altcoin supporters, but they are pretty good at fuding and making up things... (got a few things made up against me while working on talkcoin   ) ps: it doesn't mean that I don't think fpga/asic can't be developped, it just means the timing was not right (also don't forget that it also took some time to darkcoin to gain traction... )",235,Hero Member,djm34,11:44:21,2014-11-05,546,671,1,CleverHash asic mining x11 to x15.

17,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=843940.0,17,2540,djm34,"Cleverhash is probably real based on what I saw on their site. At least, their technical jargon was in order and their hashrate to power usage is about what is on par with what I expect out of a highly optimized 28nm cell based asic. HOWEVER -- their estimates are extremely generous. I would expect the device to perform at about 1/2 of the hashrate to power usage they say it will. FYI, if they were to publish the conservative figures of around 200Mh/s per 1KW no one would buy because it's not going to be profitable. Open-Silicon has a pretty impressive first run success record. But, they are a huge and slow company. I expect the timeline to be longer than what they're suggesting. The RTL for x11 is ridiculous and x15 is even worse. We started our RTL about a month before they (cleverhash) did and we're now done and moving on to the design phase (without pre-order money). To the other's that are suggesting there are x11 or x15 asics in the wild -- I doubt there are any X11 or X15 ASICs in the wild. Reason being, the cheap method to produce quick chips (structured asic ala KNC, Avalon, etc) isn't cost effective for these designs as they're too big. The only way to do these designs is cell based asic which is going to be a large lump sum NRE. Unfortunately the lump sum is about 10-20% the market cap of Darkcoin. Just to give you an idea of what we're talking in terms of speed, an FPGA I was achieving 1Gh/s at 20W with on bitcoin mining will do about 50Kh/s on X11. As far as I'm aware -- publicly -- I had the fastest single FPGA mining bitcoin for a year or more until the last gen (28nm) Xilinx chips came out. Other than that, it takes forever to put the RTL together. Imagine designing 11 or 15 different bitcoin designs and putting them all on one chip. If you thought making a bitcoin chip was tough, you haven't seen nothing yet. There are 15 different cores in their RTL. Each core is equivalent to making an entire double sha2 bitcoin mining RTL. I doubt you're going to see any of those cheap and quick chinese manuf pick up x11. They like to skip steps and cut corners to get their designs done faster. I made around $30K from my B1 avalon, I'm not complaining. But at the same time, X11/X15 is a wholly different devil. Pro Tip: Don't pre-order anything, ever. You have better odds taking all your money to the casino and putting it on black at the roulette table. Or my personal favorite, playing hard ways at the craps table. I'm amazed they're trying to go the pre-order route on an X15 ASIC. It's pure insanity on their part. Though they do have a good pump with that whole clevercoin thing or whatever they call it.

63,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=635959.40,17,7237,true-asset,"If you look at the number of FPGA logical elements needed to implement each of the X11 algorithms ( see the Athena source code link posted earlier ) and then look at the number of LE's available on all the affordable Xilinx and Altera FPGA devices you'll notice that it'd be hard to fit more than one or two of the unrolled X11 algorithms into a single FPGA. So you'd have to assume that any X11 FPGA implementation would take multiple FPGAs and require software coordination between them to implement the X11 suite. Additionally, because of the chained nature of the X11 algorithm, you'd be performing these 11 algorithms in series, so the speed of the device would be limited to the speed of the slowest algorithm. If you refer again to the Athena source code, you'll see some performance metrics for the various implementations. These two observations should allow you to assess the relative cost and performance of a hypothetical X11 FPGA implementation. My takeaway when I looked at this problem is that even though source code for the different algorithms exists in the pubic domain, a full implementation of the X11 suite in a multi-fpga PCI-e based system using commercially available prototyping boards  ( for example, http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=205&No=816 or http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/EK-S6-SP605-G.htm ) would be fairly expensive and not blazingly fast. On the other hand, if you were prepared to implement a custom board with the right mix of inexpensive Xilinx or Altera FPGAs instead of using commercially available development kits and manufacture in quantity so you could get good prices on the FPGA components, then it might be worthwhile.

I made a post similar to this a couple months ago, but at the time there were just 1-3 GH megarigs floating around which apparently is more acceptable then 100GH... You're dumb. MMR is a reputable mining website and it shows the machines operating with the current hashrates. I have no way of duplicating and showing said hashrate without MMR being in on it. Shows how little you actually know about actual mining. Go toodle with some algos and try to sell them for 45BTC. Also shows how little you know about mining and how disconnected you are from the community. MMR will reject your rigs if they aren't setup to mine a certain algo. How can you guys have went this long while being part of the mining community and never used MMR? More disturbing then all this you guys are trying to come up with crazy ass theories as to why these exist (which are simply shown to be untrue if you've used MMR once) rather then just assuming it's a FPGA/ASIC. Apparently these are part of my mining rig mega regime hell bent on taking 2 BTC before MMR takes it back due to a dispute. In other news, these seems to be legit rigs like I said. So it's time for the community to consider moving on to different algos. These only show up under x11 so I assume it's x11 only... Although it could just be the only thing worth renting for right now. As to why you don't see these on the network in one large sum. I'm sure if you own this much GH you distribute over multiple coins and pull all x11 coins down or using a profit pool switch that redistributes load across all profitable coins (I don't know why something like this doesn't exist anyway instead of constant coin hopping auto-switch pools).",439,Sr. Member,bensam123,18:30:01,2014-12-14,420,650,1,x11 FPGA/ASIC

A: The software package is called ""cpuminer"". ""minerd"" (""miner daemon"") is just the name of the executable file provided by the package. Q: My antivirus flags the Windows binary as malware. A: That's a known false positive. More information here . Q: Can I mine (insert your cryptocoin here) with this miner? A: Only if its proof-of-work algorithm is scrypt or SHA-256d. This miner does not currently support other algorithms such as Keccak, scrypt-jane, X11, etc. Forks of this project may provide additional algorithms, but I do not maintain them and they are not discussed here, so if you have questions about them please contact their authors. Q: When running configure I get the error ""C compiler cannot create executables"". A: Make sure you typed CFLAGS=""-O3"" with a big O, not with a zero. Q: autogen.sh dies with ""error: possibly undefined macro: AC_MSG_ERROR"". Q: configure chokes on something like ""LIBCURL_CHECK_CONFIG(, 7.15.2, ,'"". A: Make sure you have installed the development package for libcurl. If you have and you're still getting the error when compiling from git, try compiling from tarball instead. Q: I'm trying to connect to a Stratum server, but I get ""HTTP request failed: Empty reply from server"". A: Make sure you specified the correct protocol in the server URL ( stratum+tcp:// ). Q: Is there any command-line option I can play with to make it mine faster? A: No. The miner automatically picks the best settings for the CPU it is run on. Q: What's the difference between the two algorithms, scrypt and sha256d ? A: They are completely different proof-of-work algorithms. You must use scrypt for Litecoin, and you must use sha256d for Bitcoin. The default algorithm is scrypt , so for Bitcoin mining you have to specify --algo=sha256d . Q: Will this miner use a lot of RAM when using the scrypt algorithm? A: No, that's a GPU thing. Q: How do I make the miner write its output to a file instead of printing it to the screen? A: Just redirect the standard error stream to file: Code: minerd [OPTIONS] 2> myfile You may also want to use the --quiet / -q option to disable the per-thread hashmeter. On *nix, you probably also want to use the --background / -B option to fork in the background. Original post (December 19, 2011) follows. Please note that most of the technical details are now outdated. I have recently rewritten the heart of the scrypt hashing function used by the jgarzik/ArtForz cpuminer in assembly language, to see if this could bring some more speed. Apparently it did. The source code is now available at GitHub: https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer The build process for Linux should be the same as before. In the new code I tried to take full advantage of SSE2 instructions, which are available since the Pentium 4. Unfortunately, AMD's implementation of these instructions is not as fast as Intel's... well, ok, sadly it's nearly two times slower. For this reason, I had to write separate versions of the hashing functions. You don't need to worry about this, though, since the new function should be able to auto-detect your cpu and automatically select the best algorithm. Long polling patch This release also includes a new --timeout option that I originally added to solve a problem with long polling. Apparently the LP thread doesn't behave nicely under certain network conditions, as reported by various users. So, if you experienced high stale rates with the previous miner, you should definitely try out this new version. Many thanks to SockPuppet, aka shawnp0wers, who helped me nail down the issue! Some Technical Details The current release includes four different implementations of the scrypt core, each one designed for a different hardware. A fallback plain x86 version, to be used when SSE2 instructions are not available (Pentium III, Athlon XP and earlier processors). A 32-bit version using SSE2, for use on the Pentium 4, Pentium M, Core, Atom, plus all 64-bit cpus running in a 32-bit OS. A 64-bit version for Intel processors, i.e. Core 2, i3, i5, i7. This version can in most cases double the speed of the previous miner. A 64-bit version for AMD processors, i.e. Athlon 64, Phenom, Sempron and the like. The speed increase here can range from 5% to 80%. The first two versions only get compiled in the 32-bit miner, the last two only in the 64-bit miner. The miner uses the CPUID instruction to choose which version to use. Compiler Flags One cool aspect of assembly code is that users no more need to play with compiler flags to get the best performance. Configuring the build with just CFLAGS=""-O3"" is now more than enough to get efficient code. This also means that we no more need separate specialized binaries for Intel and AMD cpus. Just a 32-bit and a 64-bit version. Personal Notes Someone on IRC asked me why I am releasing this miner, instead of keeping it for myself or for my pool. Well, that's exactly the point. It is important for Litecoin that everybody has access to the most efficient mining software! Someone might worry about the effect of this release on market prices, but consider this: if everybody starts using the new miner, the hash rate will go up, but so will difficulty, so nothing will ultimately change. I actually think this new miner will be very beneficial to Litecoin, because it should make mining easier for beginners (see compiler flags). As crazy_rabbit wrote in another thread, one big plus of Litecoin is that everybody can participate. Well, consider this: now you can effectively mine on an Atom! Alright folks... I hope you enjoy the performance boost.

AMD on Win - OpenCL stratum pool miner is fastest AMD on Linux - OpenCL stratum pool miner is fastest. Nvidia on Win - OpenCL stratum pool miner is fastest Nvidia on Linux - CUDA is fastest. OpenCL GPU miners work on both AMD and Nvidia cards. There are both solo and pool versions. Both versions were coded by mbk and use optimizations by Wolf0 .

The miner works on Linux ONLY. Windows will not be available until Nvidia or MS update their development tools. This was developed and released open-source by Wolf0 .

On equipment -- you can make ROI in potentially 3 months.  It just depends on what alt-coin you mine, how you trade it and what equipment you buy.  There are no guarantees -- but at least with equipment you are in more control of your destiny.  This is the opposite with some ""cloud mining"" company that supposedly has all this equipment working for you. On deals -- the best thing to buy that is available right now would be the A2 Terminator miners (88Mh/s or 100Mh/s).  I've seen these go for about $1,000 USD on Ebay.  They are the most energy efficient (about 900 watts) and are solid with built in PSU and controller. On potential equipment -- Hashra is supposedly going to finally release their Astro product at the end of this month.  You can buy it in the US (using Paypal for extra security) @ $450.00 each.  The specs are stated as 100Mh/s @ 600-700 watts.  This is pretty much a preorder and Hashra was supposed to release this unit by October.  If you do buy - buy with a Credit Card through Paypal (never ever send them Bitcoin or a wire transfer -- crazy).  There is a site selling them http://shop.lifeforce.info and the owner is well known throughout these forums.  Hopefully they will come through, if not you get a refund -- or worse case dispute the charge.",564,Sr. Member,hdmediaservices,21:00:14,2014-12-12,280,638,1,Best mining machine?

DONATE (LTC): LiK1rotC2tNYNRbRfW2xsKLYJvKhQ3PwTN DONATE (BTC): 17bmYcP6Vio6c1gnyPsaDSv4B11SLe81Ab What is Litecoin? Litecoin is a cryptocurrency that uses an alternative, memory hard hashing algorithm called scrypt that was devised by mathematics' prodigy Colin Percival. The algorithm utilizes SHA256 and a stream function called salsa20 to force devices that mine it to either use a lot of memory or use dramatically more ALU cycles to perform a hash.  With the parameters used in Litecoin's implementation of scrypt (N = 1024; p = 1; r = 1), each thread uses approximately 64-128 KB depending on the settings for lookup_gap and thread_concurrency in the mining program when mining with a GPU.  Because GPUs have such fast memory (bandwidth in the hundreds of GB/s) and roughly 128-512 KB of RAM per stream processor, they are ideal for mining Litecoin.  This requirement for fast memory in order to mine quickly results in Litecoin being FPGA and ASIC resistant ; although ASICs may one day come out for Litecoin, they are not expected to garner the same performance increases as for Bitcoin (two orders of magnitude more efficient). Mining Litecoin The major factor which impacts hash rate/hardware errors is the thread_concurrency .  The second most important factor for some cards is the ratio of core speed to memory speed .  Typically optimum values of thread_concurrency are a multiple of 64 and vary per card and per card family (see below).  The (core speed/memory speed) quotient should be 0.8 or less for 5xxx/6xxx cards and 0.7 or less for most 7xxx cards.  Some evidence suggests that different 7xxx cards may have different ideal core:memory clock ratios, too. GUIMiner-scrypt is out !  Comes with all settings in this thread and all miners.  No more command line interfaces!  Try it here . For all series cards, Install AMD APP SDK: http://developer.amd.com/tools/hc/AMDAPPSDK/downloads/Pages/default.aspx Install latest AMD drivers: http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx or Use current recommend AMD driver (12.8): 13.1 32-bit 13.1 64-bit AVOID 12.10 DRIVERS, THEY SEEM TO BREAK LITECOIN PERFORMANCE. 13.X SEEM TO BE OKAY. 5xxx series cards Use cgminer . Command line to run: Code: cgminer --scrypt -o http://yourpool.com:port -u username -p password --thread-concurrency ???? -I 18 -g 1 -w 256 You can use pretty much any thread_concurrency between 1536 and 8192 that is a multiple of 64. Some people recommend using 4 or 5 * the number of SPs.  You can find those in the table here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_(GPU_family) (1st number in core config) Recommended thread concurrencies for 57xx cards: 2368-4096 (3200 is common) 58xx cards: 4096-8192 (5600, 7168, and 8000 are common) 5970 card: 4096-8192 (5632 or 8000 are common) Typical 5xxx series performance: 0.255 kh/s/shader 6xxx series cards Use cgminer . Command line to run: Code: cgminer --scrypt -o http://yourpool.com:port -u username -p password --thread-concurrency ???? -I 18 -g 1 -w 256 You can use pretty much any thread_concurrency between 1536 and 8192 that is a multiple of 64.  Some people recommend using 4 or 5 * the number of SPs.  You can find those in the table here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Islands_(GPU_family) (1st number in core config) Recommended thread concurrencies for 67xx cards: 2368-4096 (3200 is common) 68xx cards: 3008-6144 (4800 is common) 69xx cards: 4096-8192 (5600, 7168, and 8000 are common) 6990 card: 4096-8192 (5632 or 8000 are common) Typical 6xxx series performance: 0.313 kh/s/shader 7xxx series cards Use reaper or cgminer versions 2.11.3 and up (see update below).  Set thread_concurrency to somewhere slightly below 64 * bus_width_of_card_in_bits.  So, for a 7950, that would be 64 * 384 = 24576; ideal values are 21712 or 24000.  Find your bus width here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Islands_(GPU_family) To find the optimum thread_concurrency for your card, you will need to search above and below this estimate ideal value and see what is fastest. If you'd like to use reaper, follow the steps below. Make reaper.conf the following: Code: kernel reaper.cl save_binaries yes enable_graceful_shutdown no long_polling yes platform 0 device 0 # device 1 # device 2 # device 3 mine litecoin device ? must be added for every card you have to avoid using the CPU as well to mine.  Make sure when reaper starts that it states that the CPU platform is disabled.  CPU mining does not work correctly and may actually slow down GPU mining with reaper. Example configuration (550kh/s, 7950) of litecoin.conf: Code: host yourpool.com ### Do not add http://!! port 8344 user username pass password protocol litecoin worksize 256 vectors 1 aggression 20 threads_per_gpu 1 sharethreads 32 lookup_gap 2 gpu_thread_concurrency 21712 Save litecoin.conf and run reaper.exe. The 7xxx series can be tricky, for instance the 7770 seems to have an optimum thread concurrency of 8000 and works fine with cgminer and an intensity of 16 (I get 191kh/s with those settings).  The 79xx cards should be amenable to the configuration above and are the fastest possible cards you can mine with. Optimal thread concurrencies for 7xxx family: 7770: 8000 (200 kh/s, aggression 19) 7850: ???? 7870: 15360 (400 kh/s, aggression 19) 7950: 21712 or 24000 (~575 kh/s) 7970 (cgminer): 22392 (~700 kh/s can be obtained with a core/memory ratio of 0.57) 7970 (reaper): 20992, 21712, or 24000 (~ 7750: ???? 7770: 8000 (200 kh/s, aggression 19) 7850: ???? 7870: 15360 (400 kh/s, aggression 19) 7950: 21712 or 24000 (~575 kh/s) 7970 (cgminer): 22392 (~700 kh/s can be obtained with a core/memory ratio of 0.57 ) or 8192 (-g 2 -w 256 -I 13) 7970 (reaper): 20992, 21712, or 24000 (~650 kh/s can be obtained with reaper and core/memory ratio of 0.57 , e.g. 900 MHz core and 1580 MHz memory.  Over 725 KH/s can be achieved with memory overvolting.) Typical 7xxx series performance: 0.321 kh/s/shader If reaper crashes periodically on a single card, use the following python script to keep it alive (starts reaper, runs for two hours, shuts it down, then restarts it): Code: import os, subprocess, time while True:       print(""Starting reaper..."")       p = subprocess.Popen(""C:\\Users\\my-pc\\Desktop\\reaper\\reaper.exe"")       time.sleep(7200)       print(""Terminating reaper..."")       p.terminate()       time.sleep(10) This seems to fix the problem for my 3x 7950 rig. Update : 3-20-13 cgminer versions 2.11.3 and up can be used to mine with high thread concurrencies now.  Follow these instructions: WINDOWS : Open console and type Code: setx GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT 100 Now, close the console (it will not work if you open cgminer in the same window).  Open cgminer using a .bat or a new console, high thread concurrencies will now work. LINUX : Open terminal and type Code: export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100 Now high thread concurrencies should work in cgminer. TABLE OF USER REPORTED HASH RATES AND SETTINGS https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Mining-hardware-comparison CARD MEMORY SPEED SETTINGS Usually it is most effective to have the memory speed of the card equal to or greater than the core clock speed.  For some cards this is more important than others, but this is generally true.  From experimental data for a 7770 , a (core speed)/(memory speed) ratio of 0.7 or less is recommended. HETEROGENEOUS MIXTURES OF CARDS CGMINER: Use a comma to separate thread-concurrency values, eg. --thread-concurrency 3200,8000.  Values correspond to the card number in zeroeth order. REAPER: Run multiple instances of reaper.  To do this, clone the folder and then add ""device x"" to reaper.conf, where x is the number for the card in zeroeth order. RAM REQUIREMENTS ON-MOTHERBOARD The equivalent amount of system RAM as for the sum of all the vRAM used by the GPUs is required when mining with reaper .  For instance, 3x 5970s mining with thread_concurrency values of 8000 each would require 3x 500MB = 1500MB system ram (plus additional RAM for the OS).  The memory requirements for 7xxx cards are also higher because of larger thread_concurrency values, for instance a thread_concurrency of 24000 means 1.5GB system RAM per card is required. THREADS PER GPU Some people state that increased hash rates are experienced upon increasing the number of threads per GPU in 5xxx series cards (-g # in cgminer or threads_per_gpu # in reaper).  That has not been my experience with 6xxx or 7xxx cards, but you can try it and see if it helps out your hash rate. STRATUM LTC MINING Supported by some pools (ltcmine.ru, notroll.in, coinotron.com) in order to reduce the number of stales.  Typical results moving from JSON getwork to stratum is a reduction in stales from 1.5% to 0.5%.  If you use reaper, you need to use a fork which is available here and a stratum proxy .  Stratum mining works with cgminer for versions 2.10.3 and up using the ""-o stratum+tcp://yourpool.com:port"" command. Run proxy program with this command for reaper: Code: mining_proxy.exe -pa scrypt --host yourpool.com --port #### Then run reaper with the following host: Code: 127.0.0.1:8332 and your normal user/password for the pool. SOLO MINING For large hash rates.  Go here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=83371.0 The guide works the same for unix as well more or less.

4,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=897804.0,16,454,hdmediaservices,"So perhaps this has been discussed before -- maybe not. I know in the past there has always been a Bitcoin pool that was being DDOS'd.  So yeah it was an inconvenience to that particular pool's members, but it never really made an impact on the general mining of the coin, people would automatically switch to one of a dozen or more pools. Well - use this same attack on a major pool that has 2/3 the hashing of say 42 coin.  Knock them down for a day and the difficulty drops considerably and the attacked can then mine the coin quickly on their own.  I mean there aren't that many pools that mine 42 coin in any significant hash - but a couple. I believe this is now happening with Alt-Coins.  I haven't looked at the statistics to confirm, but someone is definitely trying to manipulate the difficulty of some coins for their personal gain using DDOS attacks. Several pools have been taken down (for more than a few hours) in the past week, so something is up. If you think about it -- why would this not work? If I want to mine a lot of 42 coin -- well just take down one or two pools (that mine the majority of it) for a day or two or just hours.  The difficulty will reset in a matter of minutes.  Less people mining a coin means a lower difficulty and a chance to mine more of the coin. I don't know how much a DDOS attack can cost -- but I would think it isn't too expensive. In addition - good DDOS protection for these alt coin pools might be pricey (in the whole scheme of things) or perhaps not even enabled.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of these pools are being hosted at someone's house.  Am I missing something here?  I hope so!  Curious what others think...",615,Sr. Member,hdmediaservices,21:19:59,2014-12-18,280,635,1,Attack of AltCoin Pools - DDOS

DDosing isn't really expensive at all, I could DDOS a moba game match from my computer in a few minutes. The thing about DDOS attacks is that they're hard to deal with. Most pool owners won't bother to invest in defenses against them. As you said, it's too expensive.

38,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=866632.0,16,2755,hdmediaservices,"First -- I'm curious if there are any new Scrypt ASIC machines coming?  Or is everything going into the ""so-called"" cloud - which feels a little scam-like to me, but I'm not going to judge.  It just takes out the fun for me. I've also heard of new X11 to X15 mining and Neoscrypt mining machines coming in a year.  But I will never pre-order or pay full price for a rig. From my observations, it seems that the promised: Antminer L1 units are sold out on two pre-orders and no more will be made.  Which leads me to believe that maybe this product will not even deliver on time or at all. KNC units are still an expensive hot mess and now they aren't selling anymore? The Zeusminer upgrade boards are vaporware.  Non-existant and people are being screwed on refunds or exchanges for ""cloud"" mining. So -- is this the end of new hardware?  And eventually the demise of personal Scrypt mining? My personal setup: I'm still running my units, on a good pool.  This pool does not trade the coins to BTC -- so I like that.  Adds another variable in the setup. (4) A2 Terminator 90Mh/s (average power draw 850w ea) (2) Zeusminer Hurricane X6 10Mh/s (average power draw 250w ea) (1) Zeusminer Thunder X6 20Mh/s (average power draw 460w) (1) Zeusminer Lightning X6 40Mh/s (average power draw 960w) I don't believe in over-clocking the units as I'm always worried about a fire and some wires get a little warm already.  To me pulling 1Kw out of a 15 amp circuit -- continuously -- it is not safe.  I'm sure an electrician will say otherwise - but I've seen outlets get brown in color.  That can't be a good sign. Out of all these -- the A2 Terminator machines are by far the most quiet, best performing and are really well built.  I paid $1500 each for them about 2 months ago.  They of course came with built in PSU and controller.  One unit, seems to pull more power than all the others (like 980watts) - so I under clock it.  Also, I've heard that if you run these on a 220v circuit, they use less wattage, but I'm not willing to rewire. The Zeusminer X6 10Mh/s units perform as expected.  They are abit noisy and generate the typical amount of heat.  I paid $400 for one 3 months ago and $200 for one 1.5 months ago.  I use an existing Gold 850w Corsair PSU with one PCIE connection each. The Zeusminer X6 20Mh/s unit performs ok - but is super loud and the two PCIE connections to my Gold 850w Corsair PSU get quite hot sometimes, so I usually either cool it off for an hour each day or under-clock it.  I paid $300 for it about 2 months ago and used an existing PSU. The Zeusminer X6 40Mh/s unit performs terribly for me - it is also super loud and just generates a lot of heat.  I'm lucky to get 35Mh/s with maybe 10% error rate.  Using a Gold 1200w Corsair PSU with four PCIE connections.  I paid $700 for it about 3 months ago and used an existing PSU.  I don't always run this unit because I don't like it - lol.  950 watts for maybe 35Mh/s.  Too much heat and too much power. So am I making a profit or recovered my costs?   I admit I'm not the best accountant on figures -- but rough estimate I am probably making .9 to .15 BTC daily.  This can really fluctuate, since I am not always trading in my alt coins for BTC immediately or there are long delays in getting the actual coins (big example with be BTM coin).  I'm not seeing a dramatic drop in what I make each week (especially compared to BTC mining) -- so it is still fun. Obviously I have not gotten my ROI - which I guess would be close to $8k.  I believe right now I've made about 6 BTC and even at $500 each would only be $3k.  I'll definitely sit on the BTC in hopes it might spike really high, but who knows.  Everyone has a different prediction.  I eventually expect to reach my ROI -- but it will take some time and hopefully the equipment won't break down prior. Oh - and yes - electricity!   Where I am - electric is about 11 cents per kw/h.  Not the best - but definitely not the worst.  Half of my electric is not out of pocket and half of it is.  Basically some of my equipment is at home and the rest is at another location. What about heat?   Not much of a problem now since the temperatures outside are dropping and I have windows available, but I still have to monitor it as they are tucked away so I do not hear them.  I use the WeMo Insight Wifi Switches to monitor the units power usage by smartphone.  It is great, in that I can shut them down if I feel it is getting too hot and also it tells me the actual wattage being used.  Being a worrier -- if I go on vacation, I usually turn off my units at home and monitor the others religiously.  I always keep a smoke alarm nearby and fire extinguisher.  I use multiple circuits and of course keep any combustibles away from the equipment.  I can also monitor the units via camera and login to them remotely. Would I sell my units?   Probably not.  I'm in this for the fun and I've heard horror stories of selling your gear on Ebay.  I guess if someone locally offered me double what I paid -- maybe, but then there goes my little hobby (preventing me from getting real work done).

I remember seeing their product on Ebay -- selling at $200 with a shipping charge of like $1000.  It definitely spooked me.  LOL Another interesting thing is that the A2 Terminator 88Mh/s unit is listed at 700 watts -- yet mine consume more like 850 watts.  I believe the 700 watt rating is if you run the unit at 220 volts instead of 120 volts.

The solution was to take off the pci-e adapter and get a power supply that plugs in direct to the psu such as the EVGA gold 750. You do NOT need this adapter, and I feel it gets so hot its unsafe. Its the crappy thin wires on the adapters that gets so hot.

38,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=866632.0,16,2755,hdmediaservices,"Thanks for the great tip.  Yes - the hot to the touch adapter feels very unsafe -- so I've been afraid to clock it past 200Mhz (and run it 24/7).  I have an EVGA PSU and will try what you said.  Do the cables plug directly into the boards?  Or do you have to strip and solder them on? What speeds are you getting at 260Mhz? I wish there was a fix for the X6 Lightning (claimed to be 40Mh/s).  950 watts for less than 35Mh/s (if I'm lucky) seems like some type of flaw.  I've tried everything with this unit -- including their special Raspberry Pi image -- and it gives so many hardware errors.  I wonder if you can just run it with just two of the PCIE connectors (instead of all 4)?  I did try just two of the power connectors, but then one of the fans would not turn on, so I didn't go any further.  I guess I would have to hardwire power to that particular fan, as I'm sure it would overheat if all three fans were not running.

NOT all power supplys can do this. I tried 5 different high end power supplies before finding the EVGA 750 that could plug direct.  I get 24-25mhs  @ 260 clock with single digit hw errors. 5-9% usually, and no rejects, and never a shut offf, ever. Let me be more specific: The power supply I use is the EVGA 750 supernova nex G. Purchased from Newegg. What makes the direct plug in possible is by removing the pci-e modular cables on the EVGA, youll find that the pci-e female connectors on that power supply fit perfect with the zeus thunder X6. When I tried the same thing with 4 or 5 other psus the female modular connector on the psus would not fit. Hope this helps. So youll remove the pci-e cables from the power supply, and remove the adapter from the blade. Take the power cable from the blade and connect it direct into the pci-e connector on the EVGA. I plugged my cables in diagonal or ""kitty corner' from each other, NOT on the same side as their were 4 pci-e connectors on the evga. Not that it would be bad to plug the cables on the same side, but I seem to remember that I had a few shut off issues due to power draw. This was resolved by plugging them the way I described.

I was replying mainly to the crackpot theory that I was somehow a mastermind behind this rig trying to scam people (which apparently is someone who has critical thinking skills?), when they obviously knew nothing about MMR. Putting that aside, you could load balance such a rig across all the coins, not just one. Drk has 82 GH alone over the entire network. A easy place to check this is on suchpools page. http://suchpool.pw/# Such machines may also be laying dormant as overloading the network would be wildly unprofitable, unless they're paid in advance for it. And no, AFAIK, MMR is a proxy, which is how it checks algos when you first connect to it. Also why you need to select a close server to yourself and if MMR server goes down, your rig rental does too. DJM you aren't even worth replying to bro. Calling someone a troll when that's all you do is something entirely different. All you do is bitch and moan about miners stealing your non-existent donations and then ridicule someone when they bring anything worthwhile to light. And you would know a 'pool' could very easily be a load balanced pool that distributes the hash over more then one coin... Nicehash for instance. Don't be a dumbass who apparently 'lacks critical thinking' as world boss Kotarius looks down upon those and wishes you much money loss.

Sorry but you fit entirely the definition of a troll, as you don't care about what others write and responds in terms which are insulting (reason of my previous answers). and even though you have been proven to be entirely wrong you will continue like if nothing happened. We all know by now that this 170GH/s doesn't exist because it cannot be accounted anywhere in x11 coins hashrate, so why don't you just admit you were wrong and stop there rather than continuing like if nobody didn't say anything. 170GH/s is almost twice DRK hashrate, so it should be visible, if you can't see it on DRK hashrate then it doesn't exist and since DRK is the only x11 coin which is valuable there is very little chance the owner of any 170GH/s machine would lose power and usage on some shitcoin (which would get forked instantly.... even if it was the case, that would be easy to spot, like it was very easy to spot when the knc asic started to mine scrypt-n on VTC....)

96,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=811390.0,16,6152,clem84,"Pretty much... Mining is a sinking ship for miners right now. It doesn't help that every coin an their mom is PoS now. The big coins that have sailed through x11 and x13 to PoS is mind boggling. The only ones getting fucked are miners. I'm definitely considering parting my rigs. 'Break Even' with power isn't breaking even. It doesn't include ROI; Outstanding loans and interest (if applicable) and the fact that you're sitting on a buttload of money in hardware which is constantly depreciating. I don't think that will ever come around. With the invention of sites like Nicehash, miners that are dying off are sucking other miners down with them. People who use Nicehash don't have to worry about returns, so they'll pay as little as possible for coins pulling everything down with it until miners simply turn their miners off. If you look at NH right now for instance, everything is super negative. I highly doubt those miners are paying a lot less in power then me, all have super optimized kernels, or super efficient hardware. They're just circling the drain and sucking everyone else down with them as they go. It will always gravitate towards the bottom. Even as difficulty decreases due to less miners, it will still equalize with power rates, as the only ones who will make more money are NH users and not miners, especially considering that the market is essentially run by bots. The cycle continues over and over again till we're just left with average joes mining on their CPUs on a whim. The hardware war of ASICs doesn't exist in the GPU scene, so buying your way to the top doesn't work. We're all stuck with the same hardware. If there was any one thing responsible for the death of GPU mining right now I'd say it's cloud mining like NH. It gives miners that don't know where to find coins a glimmer of hope where there is none and people who can find coins the ability to suck them dry.",707,Sr. Member,bensam123,17:57:57,2014-11-11,420,630,1,October 2014.

Set the parameters for each card helps perhaps. Also for the finetuning. If your computer is dedicated to mining you can raise the Intensity to 16 or even more. Shaders setting is obsolete as long you are also using the thread-concurrency setting. Also the thread-concurrency can lead to HW errors if it is set too low.

I'm finding about 400Mh/s can make you about .10 to .15 a day -- but that is if you choose the coins you mine and not use a multi pool that automatically converts to BTC.  There are so many variables -- hard to get it down to a solid number.  But you definitely cannot go on auto-pilot and expect to make a lot (at least in my experience).,836,Sr. Member,hdmediaservices,21:33:30,2014-12-02,280,634,2,Where are we today with ASIC Scrypt Hardware?

I'm not happy with ""cloud mining"" as it exists currently, because there is zero transparency across the board. I don't see anyone offering metrics on the size of their farms, the percentage of hashrate leased, the uptime, power cost, or anything at all that is meaningful to people looking at buying hosted/cloud hashrate. People should be able to have some reasonable expectations when it comes to information about what they're buying, but companies like GAWMiners and others intentionally obscure it, or make it so convoluted that people aren't even sure exactly WHAT they're buying...buying nothing but marketing and hype, following the pied piper as a cult forms around him, everyone willing and eager to drink the Kool-Aid. I like controlling my hashrate, seeing it and knowing exactly what it's doing. Unfortunately, hardware makers are still being allowed to gouge consumers with their exorbitant retail prices, because people are willing to pay it. Right now, with price and difficulty being where they are, I wouldn't pay more than $3.50/MH for Scrypt/Litecoin mining. Hence, I'm still on the sidelines until prices come down to what I consider to be a reasonable level...and I'll never, ever pre-order again. These things may never come to pass. In which case, I will take the money I would have spent on hardware and simply hold it in Litecoin for the long term. I enjoy mining though, so I hope things turn around. I don't like the cloud trend at all.",840,Sr. Member,FreeJack2k2,22:09:25,2014-12-02,364,634,2,Where are we today with ASIC Scrypt Hardware? (And my personal story)

We saw the profit potential for BTC slowly fade away -- and now there is none. This will happen with Scrypt mining as well -- but luckily we have a gazillion different coins to choose from - so I haven't lost hope -- but then again -- I don't expect to get rich on this either.  Those days were gone a long time ago.  This should be considered a hobby for anyone buying miners.  But hey maybe we'll get lucky and BTC will hit $10k -- seems like a long shot to me though (or even $1k). What concerns me though is all of the ""Cloud Mining"" stuff cluttering up the forums.  It seems so many people are saying to try this company or that company -- and of course their affiliate code is attached to the link.   That is upsetting as the poster has something to gain by recommending one company over another.  Plus - if it sounds too good to be true -- you know it is!  People need to pull out their calculators and do the math.  Honestly - if you want to mine with someone else's equipment -- use one of the sites that rents other peoples miners to you. Totally transparent, you supply the parameters and pool and you get what you pay for.  I originally rented some of my Bitcoin miners on there and made some decent coin for a while.  There is MiningRigRentals and BetaRigs (just to name two).  I had a good experience with BetaRigs.  This is the way to go as you won't get scammed and you have full control.",841,Sr. Member,hdmediaservices,22:30:22,2014-12-02,280,634,2,Where are we today with ASIC Scrypt Hardware?

Via GPU produced the following: share (accepted): 594 share (rejected): 4 Hours: 20 of work On CPU produced more as seen below: shares: 674 rejected: 4 just over 17 hours work If thread number seen in above has something to do with number of my cpu cores than using CPU while using sgminer isn't best!

Thousands of dollars worth of hardware that is depreciating isn't the same thing (They've already lost 2/3s their value since last spring) 30 cards wouldn't heat large buildings. That's probably 6000w worth of heat at x11, that's enough for a small house depending on how cold it is and how well it's insulated. Gas is cheaper then electric for heating as well, much cheaper. Opportunity cost. What could you be doing with the $5000 instead of having it depreciate in your basement as a space heater. Like put it in a savings account. If you bought those cards with a loan, you're talking interest on top of it, which slightly more then break even isn't covering. This goes back to spring time, when everyone is super negative (heat isn't subsidized anymore)and it'll either force everyone to sell or sit on it for another six months, which the hardware will depreciate further. If they sell, it'll crash the reusable market and further depreciate the cards. Efficiency isn't a foreign concept that's up for definition. More hash when you lose more money is not more efficient. Hashrate is dynamic. If everyone has the same 280x and is using the same kernel, if the hashrate is 1GH/s or 1h/s per 280x it doesn't matter (if they're hashing at the same speed). What does matter is how much power is being used to achieve that. Hashrate is a arbitrary number used to denote how much work a card is doing. The percentage of the pie stays the same (all else being equal) as the difficulty will adjust. I bet it did. Except that heater costs $5000 and you could sell that and buy yourself a nice high efficiency furnace and redo the insulation in your house. Not to mention it'll depreciate greatly over the next year. A furnace and insulation will not. Opportunity cost, depreciation, artificially depressing the market for the sake of spiting others.

Having close to that number of GPUs, I can tell you it will maybe heat a small house using x11. Blast furnace my ass. You have no idea how many BTUs a normal furnace puts out to heat your home (hydronic or forced air). Gas is ridiculously cheaper and so are furnaces. Not everyone uses the excuse 'hobby' to operate at a loss. If that's you, obviously talking about trade offs and profit doesn't apply to you. There are plenty of people who got into GPU mining to make a profit, I'd say most people did. The residual may be hobbyists after everything crashes and burns, but we're in the middle of crashing right now, which is why I'm trying to talk to people in various ways.

96,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=811390.40,16,6152,clem84,"If you're heating a 'condominium', I'm guessing scrounging for money with GPUs isn't on your table... and if you are, seriously bro, do something around your pay grade. Not sure where you're mining, but you need a LOT of GPUs to make $5000 over winter. Winter being about five months of cold season, I'd make a fraction of that in RAW BTC and I am using about 25 GPUs. You're probably talking about $2000, not including power, which will eat all of that. No one uses oil to heat their homes anymore, that's ancient (and if you do for god sakes by a high efficiency gas furnace). A standard natural gas bill for a bigger house (like mine) runs about $60 a month. That's $300 over the course of the entire winter. I'm definitely starting to think whoever is left mining BTC (on GPUs) aren't the brightest bunch, which is why we're left in the predicament we are and unfortunately I bought into this. Show me how you're profiting and then I'll believe it. Fresh was one, x11 at the beginning was another. Reread the definition of opportunity cost. If you're still making a profit on GPU mining you're either using maxwell GPUs or your calculations aren't working out. Opportunity cost is not just making profit either, it's what you could do with the money if you weren't otherwise investing it in say GPUs. Like buying a high efficiency furnace instead of a oil heater you still apparently have, redoing your insulation in your subzero arctic renaissance era condominium. If the trend of the market is anything, it's that it basically reached equilibrium at power prices ($300-$400 per BTC), so it's not going to spike to $1000. like I said I don't think I'm being grouped with the smartest bunch anymore. As per your last statement, you're betting on the lottery. Artificially depressing the market is raising difficulty by subsidizing it with something that wont always be there. Heating costs. As I described earlier, when spring time rolls around, everyone who is operating super negative now will either be forced to sell (and there seem to be a lot of people mining at a loss right now) and it'll further push the resale value of GPUs even lower due to the supply surging to market. Or they'll hang onto it till next winter which it'll depreciate again. Opportunity cost also includes you hanging onto a 280x, which has already been depreciated by the release of maxwell and furthermore by 970/980, which AMD reduced the price of the cards. A high efficiency furnace doesn't depreciate in value every three months. Yes, there are a lot of really stupid people clinging to cards. I didn't expect so many people to still have rigs laying around. Either that or chinese farmers all sold and bought maxwells, which is a possibility, but highly unlikely. With the increase in difficulty it has to be people using GPUs as space heaters. If people are so against selling right now, I'm sure they wouldn't be smart enough to liquidate and buy maxwells.",974,Sr. Member,bensam123,05:13:43,2014-11-24,420,630,3,October 2014.
