Build a giant networked supercomputer on the p2p standard for a massive parallel supercomputer hospital network, invest in solar energy to keep energy costs down. 2)   Buy more ASICs for bitcoin mining, Buy FPGAs like the Vertex 7 to have programmable chips that can do any specialized work you need, start using the Hospital supercomputer network to design the next generation of HealthCare oriented ASICs using what you learn from the FPGAs sell your chips to other hospitals, make your chips open source to maximize innovation, savings, and allow other hospitals to be able to charge for their own design. Being able to have your innovation opensource and allowing others to be able to make a living off that innovation creates a 1000 fold acceleration in world wide adoption, design innovation, eventual money saving return as other healthcare techs find improvements in efficiency and features. apply for a creative commons licence with the ability to charge for the design, this way if they want to innovate they better have a revolutionary design if they want to get out of the creative commons licence. 30 years from now, if this is followed it will be the end of disease as we know them, we will just have to worry about man made pathogens; with the kind of power the singularity that Ray Kurzweil has spoken of will bring, i'm sure someone will figure out how to turn someone into jelly without killing them sooner or later, we'll need a cure for that. 3) pay people in bitcoins to use their GPUs to do medical research for the Hospital network, create new drugs, the infrastructure that can be created is thousands of times greater than anything the pharmaceutical companies can afford... trust me there are a lot of people that cannot keep up with Bitcoins Encryption system, they are forced to upgrade to keep up we'll need those nvidia Cuda ready cards and those inefficienct GPUs to create the next generation of medical breakthroughs.

People who need insurance simply pay a fee to a decentralized Bitcoin escrow network for their healthcare. Certified professionals (docters) hold a private key to tap into that escrow fund. If 6 peers (3 patients, 3 doctors) approve the need for healthcare payments, the patient receives the cash, which he can use to pay the doctor. Advantages of a P2P healthcare system: 1. Everybody can sign up - no background checks, no denial of insurance (democrats love this); 2. Everybody can decide their own monthly fee; 3. Anyone who has paid into the pool can get healthcare; 4. System maintenance cost is much lower than commercial healthcare (you get more healthcare for your $); 5. The government cannot force you to participate (republicans love this); 6. The network/protocol can automatically identify abusers and lock them out permanently; 7. people can organize different pools. For example, republican billionaires don't have to be in the same pool as the 99% - everybody is free to organise their own pool. This satisfies both 'democrat' and 'republican' needs. In fact, any group of people could organise their own healtcare pool. The 99% could have their own pool and the 1% could have their own pool. Who cares?

The private key is tied to a certain address as the address is calculated from it. No, they are not reversible. The private key has a corresponding public key. If you spend coins the public key gets known. It is to our current knowledge not possible to calculate a private key from a public key. You would have to brute force it and due to the larger numbers thats not possible either. If you never spend any coins the public key is not known and your private key is also protected by the hash functions used, which are also not reversible. Hash functions are also considered to be quantum secure. If anyone should guess your passphrase and the way you convert it to a number they have your private key and can spend your funds.

11,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1082416.0,11,471,The Bad Guy,"Brainwallets are in general a very bad idea. The main reason is that is very very difficult that you can come up with a sentence you can remember and that software built on purpose cannot guess. That said. If: You have a sentence made of AT LEAST 15 words ISome of these words have no sense for anyone in the world except you This sentence contains any kind of special character like& ( ] # £"" ./ and so on It contains numbers as well This sentence or even a close one cannot be found searching of the internet with google or whatever else IMHO you can try to play with it. After all the concept behind brainwallets is so fascinating I would personally risk some spare cash to learn. Being able to carry some emergency ""argent de poche"" everywhere in the world is really appealing. It make you feel ""007"" (even if you are risking)   Just remember no expert will tell you ever this is a good idea. And the reality is often worse than your worst expectations. But how can I build a brainwallet? The easiest way is to put your sentence in a saved offline version of bitaddress.org, to send some funds (very few) to the generated address and delete everything in the safest way possible. When one day you need cash you can regenerate the private key by doing a sha256 on the original and sentence (better offline) and swiping the generated private key (the result of the hashing operation) onto you mobile bitcoin wallet. It is important to swipe your private key and not to import it because you take down the risk a little bit. But is it safe? Once again no. But done properly can be not so dangerous and can be ok for experiments with little amounts and can teach you something about the actual functioning of bitcoin. Is there something else I can do? Yeah. I'm fascinated by the possibility to create a BIP32 wallet from a ""brainseed"". I mean you can apply a SHA512 to your sentence and make it the seed for your BIP32 wallet. In this way you can store amounts of bitcoins in many addresses and regenerate any of them when you need. Again this a good way to learn by doing how BIP32, private keys and addresses work but it is not safe for your funds. I would use this just to learn exciting things and I would consider loosing the entire amount a fair cost for the fun. With a couple of dollars you can pay yourself a lot of fun. But what is the difference with the 12 words sentence Electrum gives you? Electrum sentence is derived from a big number generated with the best technology for randomness available at that scale. It is orders of magnitude more unguessable than the sentence you can came up with. If you have good memory is much more practical to memorize the sentence and to type it into a clean offline copy of Electrum each time you want to use the bitcoins. But for this approach to be safe it is better you keep a deseeded copy of your wallet on a connected computer and that you type your memorized seed on an offline copy of Electrum only when you want to sign a transaction.",119,Full Member,gabridome,11:50:56,2015-06-06,156,440,1,How to make brainwallet ?

102,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1086736.100,6,3409,colinistheman,"Let me first say that we agree that if the Core-chain drops to only 5% of the mining power, it's likely not to survive. I do, however, think there are many plausible scenarios in which the Core-chain survives. It only needs to make it through the first two difficulty adjustments after the fork. I suspect this will be easiest if the real fork happens (the first >1MB block is successfully mined) approximately halfway through the adjustment period. Suppose Gavin's threshold of 75% of miners is met, but only just. With 25% of the miners still mining on the original chain, the Core-chain would drop to approximately one block every 40 minutes and the difficulty adjustment would come within 2 months. That's survivable. Once it's clear it can survive, it's even possible some miners come back. A lot would depend on the Core price vs. XT price, if that can even be measured during those first few days and weeks. Here's an even more likely scenario. It's easy to imagine the XT miner votes plateauing at, say, 60% for a few months. I've read enough of these threads to feel confident that the reaction to that will not be, ""oh well, we can't get the miners on board, so let's stick with the 1MB cap."" The reaction will be to lower the threshold. This became very clear to me after seeing that clip of Mike Hearn saying that he would support the fork even with a minority of the hashing power. It's very clear to me that if the Core-chain can maintain at least 40% of the mining power than it will survive. Don't get me wrong. I think a fork will be a disaster for the price of both coins. Not to mention colored coins and counterparty. A fork of bitcoin will fork those too. I'm not a miner, so I don't really need to pick a side here. There are good arguments both for and against raising the block size limit. I get the feeling those in favor of raising the block size limit have convinced themselves they're 95% and there are 5% of holdouts, roughly. If they're right, then probably this hard fork won't be nearly as dramatic as it could've been. But I think they're wrong, and I think there's no way to convince them they're wrong except through the fork itself. Sorry for the wall of text.

In a sense, Bitcoin XT is an alternative wallet for Bitcoin, like Electrum and MultiBit are. This supports what you're saying. However, Electrum and MultiBit (AFAIK) do not change the consensus algorithm. Bitcoin XT is about to change the consensus algorithm. Suppose Electrum updated their wallet so that it would check a different POW algorithm than sha256 after a certain block height. It's clear to me that after that block height it would no longer be a wallet for Bitcoin. One could argue that it's no longer a wallet for Bitcoin as soon as the alternative code is released. It might agree with Bitcoin for a while, but the fact that the consensus code is different means it isn't the same coin -- it will just appear to be for a while. Bitcoin XT is in the process of changing the consensus code. I understand that the people who support this change will insist on calling it ""Bitcoin."" But if both chains survive, it seems like the one following the older consensus algorithm has more of a claim to the older name. I know that the official position of those in favor of bigger blocks is: the old chain will not survive.

At that point the two coins can be spent independently. It might take several tries to do this successfully, since when she spends 1 XBTC to her address A someone might publish the same transaction on the BTC-network before she can send the 1 BTC to address B.

They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. 31 A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32 So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 The next day he took out two denarii[c] and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’ 36 “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?” 37 The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.” Jesus told him, “ Go and do likewise .” Therefore, I say to you, Go And Do Likewise With Your Bitcoins(money)",356,Sr. Member,bitbets,23:46:18,2015-06-08,364,400,3,Bitcoin as a catalyst for Health Care (Worldwide)

Distributed hard coded virtual healthcare, take out the middleman, excellent idea but quite possible extreme opposition from insurance companies loved by patients, can't apply x>y= no health insurance... impossible to abuse a hard coded open source system; The health care contract is the overall available money in the system pegged to a market value according to available positions, it would be in the best interest of hospitals to keep their open spots down to a minimum by lowering cost to bring by more patients. it can even be used to assign and keep track of patients being monitored by Doctors and Nurses If they get over a set amount of patients their wages go up, slowing down the amount of patients coming their way, The best Doctors with the highest demand get the better wages according to their track record recorded on the blockchain... healthy patients equal more money for them, more difficult higher cost procedures gravitate more doctors to fill the gap... it's a market based approach that keeps track of what is going on in the system at all times. Good for Doctors,Nurses and Patients. Encrypted collaborative healthcare, patient comes in with encrypted key for his files, Doctor gets immediate access to all data stored by previous doctors visited by patient. If research is needed special health care miners, specialized ASIC machinery made to wade through the data, go through all databases x'ing out all encrypted patient details and applying statistical analysis over all patient data in all connected hospitals on request by authorized healthcare researchers. Using Bitcoin... buy an ASIC, the Bitcoin lottery is subsidizing the growth of the network till the transaction fees vs reward for the lottery becomes insanely difficult to justify. Think of it as Trickle up economics, Bernacky is printing out the cash at the top and Bitcoin is distributing the cash at the bottom... till the fees become more lucrative. start Bitcoin fundraisers... if people convert their cash to bitcoins, and you only use them when the price is high, then you win, over all, the wins and losses are negligible for a non-profit organization, it's like gaining x amount of dollars above what was donated... if always spent at it's peak. start your own HealthCoins, copy bitcoins system exactly and pay people for doing research on your behalf , have people exchange HealthCoins for Bitcoins when they need to opt in to the HealthCoin blockchain for medical insurance. The Research miners get paid in HealthCoins early adopters begin distributing the HealthCoins as a reward for helping you find new cures or help out existing patients, use the altruism of early adopters to help spur the movement, knowing that they are paying for their insurance. and you must not forget that Bitcoin is not just a money transfer program, or a currency, it is a stock option all in one! The more volume of transactions per day the higher the price goes. Same for HealthCoin, the more people opt in to the program the more valuable each HealthCoin becomes, giving the same benefits as Bitcoin, people are incentivised to stay with your plan because the longer they stay the more valuable your Coin becomes, the more incentivized your organization becomes to do a great job.

I think using anonymous health data in the block chain to spot large trends in a community can be even bigger. Imagine:                          Watching a community health problem trend in real time and making preventive changes to limit the problem.                          What about using the Big Data concept for sub communities to decide where to place health services.                          Even anonymous Genealogy/ health records of large extended families in medium sized towns, cities  could be good.                          One would simply assign a tag that represents a family name in that town, city and small country.                          Health reward through bitcoins to highlight and support communities that are doing it right can also be used.                          Taking a census every decade not the answer.                          its about catching the problems before or as it happens to make a change.

Not only will micro payments be helpful to find the proper fit for a teacher or method. (from DIY to one on one classes)  Doctors, specialists, nurse practitioners could also do short online interviews.  This could be helpful to find the right person, and allow people who want more control over their services to not feel like they are restricted by an insurance company or whatever random recommendations they are able to get.  Of course in this situation a micro payment might be .2 - .05 BTC but in comparison to the normal overhead you have to pay for just by walking in a door this is nothing.",361,Sr. Member,FCTaiChi,00:38:51,2013-06-01,308,400,2,Bitcoin as a catalyst for Health Care (Worldwide)

Those miners send the bitcoins back to the health network becoming the biggest mining operation in the world.  Because it will be a huge amount, Bitcoin itself will be the pool, and monitor the blockchain for fairness (individuals will also have this ability).  The bitcoin itself will be invested (either into real currency or stay digital.  It will also be used to exchange payments to doctors in their local currency.  Profits will be invested into multiple industries around the world in order to sustain the system regardless of if bitcoins can be mined or not (necessary consumption goods), such is the case that will happen in the year 2146.  Eventually the products you buy such as salt or cars, because of investments will return portions of that to the bit care health network, (you go to the store and buy lets say bitbread to make a sandwich).  Because of new ""bit"" industries which arise to make goods for healthcare it also creates jobs while at the same time decentralizing insurance and healthcare. Eventually healthcare and insurance becomes a single payer peer to peer system facilitated by bitcoin (cryptocurrency) with healthcare paid for by consumption only, (which is sustainable as everyone consumes).  Then, everyone around the world can visit any doctor in the world that is a member of the bitcare network for free.  All they will have to do is continue to buy the same things they always buy, but their healthcare will actually own all or portions of that.  The bitcoin is an excellent way to initiate this exchange.  This system will remove governmental controls/nationalized healthcare, and base it on free enterprise. While at the same time the bitcoin can be used in the single payer system to pay doctors and hospitals in their local currencies. I hope I explained that well enough.  It will take me a little while to finish the paper itself.  This is just the starting basics: www.bitcarehealthnetwork.org",363,Newbie,Xzis,18:34:53,2014-01-30,6,400,2,Bitcoin as a catalyst for Health Care (Worldwide)

Since the tax code provides that health insurance premiums are considered pre-tax, most people have their insurance through their employers. Thus most purchasers of insurance don't directly know the premium being paid and evaluate it against the benefits received. The apparent cost of bottom dollar coverage, like only paying $20 for your $100 primary care visit, is reduced, and so people pay to insure things that wouldn't normally be insured. They also don't tend to know the true cost of the visit, the lab tests that are ordered, the medicines, etc. In such a market, of course the price of everything goes up and up.

The blockchain part of Bitcoin could simply be a synchronized back-end for a Hospitals network, every time a nurse admits a patient, they send a update that updates all copies of the ledger, this way wherever they go afterward a doctor can have a patients complete record with contact information from all previous doctor assesments. The ledger could be made tamper proof or encrypted so only authorized people can view that information. A lot of different information can be put on a synchronized database, patient plans, insurance, pre-payment information and for qualified providers global coverage, synchronized so wherever you go, you can be sure you'll be taken care of properly without anyone following you around, you may even choose to pay for a procedure lay-away style, synchronized so any participating Doctor can help you and redeem the money, through blockchain escrow. for other situations it could be partly encrypted so that contact information for your insurance provider  can be seen by non-participating Health regions, or basic health information in case of emergency, like a medical tattoo but better. I mean what can't you do, when you have a group of institutions sharing a synchronized ledger with all relevant data? just imagine if there was a open DNA project where you could upload your entire DNA profile for researchers to analyze? any project that wanted to move forward in Human DNA research could whenever they needed the data they can have it,  in fact any research project can make all their data sets immediately available to anyone with a synchronized ledger, as soon as someone makes a new entry, everyone within the network knows... this truly is an amazing concensus building technology. It could improve collaborative research projects, by adding hierarchies and structure to the Blockchain. adapt this p2p model with BitTorrent and you have a downloadable synchronized database. I was even thinking it could use magnet links as well, simply by grabbing the patients hash code, all relevant research viewed by the doctors could be tagged as they view it, done automatically by ledger updating software to the same ledger or another for doctor reference. pass a hash of the data every so often into the Bitcoin blockchain or in any other blockchain and you have data security without applying your own proof of work scheme. Edit: for maximum practicality, what we can do now is what should be implemented, a simple database synchronizing both web, telephone, and in person contact between patients and doctors, a simple backend that any front end interface can update, whether it is a smart phone based booking, or direct doctor to pharmacist/hospital staff co-ordination of services; Basically, a workflow based database, that simply requires that a Front end interface observe the changes in the Blockchain and alert the required staff or medical services... instant synchornization of all staff within a Health Region, that could be very powerful.",372,Hero Member,jdbtracker,17:46:46,2014-02-27,658,400,2,Bitcoin as a catalyst for Health Care (Worldwide)

That should tell you how much we truly love screwing our own people. Physicians, hospital administrators and big pharma are the new banker class. Just like lawyers have always been, physicians are now far more interested in helping themselves make money than helping out their clients, aka patients.

Actually, I'd be really interested to see a different proof-of-work scheme upon hard fork.  A random (or weighted) selection of CPU-friendly algorithms do solve blocks seem to me that they would result in two worthwhile goals:  1) making it feasible for independent nodes to mine again which would produce incentive for broad node distribution, and 2) precluding attack from the build-up of sha256 asic farms.  The current mega-miners obviously would not like it, but what are they going to do other than to try their level best to make a pure sha256 fork be dominant and use whatever money/power they can muster to attack the fork in standard ways available to most everyone? My interest in Bitcoin has been as a backing store (a-la sidechains) from pretty much when I got started back in 2011.  My rational for wanting Bitcoin to be as ultra-lightweight as possible is that I would see everyone who is running sidechains of any type as also running Bitcoin nodes.  That is how I would see the infrastructure supporting the solution be broadly distributed.  If sidechains compete among themselves for settlement on the backing store, and need the backing store to be rock solid, they have several incentives to support it irrespective of the payout for doing so.  Running Bitcoin infrastructure at a profit or at least a break-even would be great and likely quite possible. I'm lobbying for the Blockstream guys to take the opportunity offered by Hearn and Andresen to do some major hard-fork changes of their own.  Possibly along he lines of what I mentioned, or other.  If I have to choose a fork anyway, I'm anxious to choose one which I think has long-term potential.  I see the best outcome for humanity coming out of a total war, and Hearn+Andresen drew first blood.  Alternately, I'm fine to see a split be amicable and each fork can stand on it's own merits.  I'd still want to see a highly defensive posture and MAD-inspired strategies ready to be called into action if necessary.",399,Legendary,tvbcof,09:24:10,2015-06-04,1456,480,3,2 blockchains coexisting is NOT what will happen.

If, hypothetically, there was no block reward right now, based on the transaction volume we are getting now, how much fee would need to be paid on each transaction to give at least the current average level of fees plus the 25 BTC reward?  Last time I bothered to do the math, we were averaging about 750 transactions per block.  By my figures, each transaction would have to have a fee of about .034 BTC just to cover the 25 BTC reward, plus a bit extra for the current fees that are already being paid (so there's no loss of mining revenue).  How many people are going to pay about $8 USD in fees for every single transaction?  If people aren't willing to pay that much, there will be even fewer transactions and that cost will then rise further.  But increase the number of transactions in the block, rather than limiting it, then you can spread that cost over a greater number of users, making it more affordable.  Obviously we can squeeze in a few more than the 750 we're averaging at the moment, but we genuinely do need more users than the system will currently support to make this thing sustainable in future.",415,Hero Member,DooMAD,20:45:17,2015-06-01,588,480,2,2 blockchains coexisting is NOT what will happen.

Same with this unspendable address: http://blockchain.info/address/1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr That one was used for Counterparty's proof-of-burn. People sent bitcoins to that address to prove that they were ""burned"" (i.e. destroyed) so that they could be rewarded with the equivalent amount of XCP coins. It's also possible for coins in an address to be lost forever by simply deleting the private key that corresponds to the address. Your wallet.dat file contains private keys corresponding to addresses in your wallet. Permanently deleting this file from your computer would make any bitcoins stored in that wallet to become permanently inaccessible. While technically speaking, it may be possible to guess the private key and regain access to these coins, private keys are long and random enough that it would take billions upon billions of years to find a successful match. As for transaction fees, they aren't lost. They go to the miner that solves the next block. Usually this is a pool and miners who mine in that pool get the fees in addition to the block reward.",545,Sr. Member,Lorenzo,11:40:54,2015-06-24,350,40,3,How many Bitcoins are lost forever?

22,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1065900.0,17,707,MicroGuy,"Bitcoin has a problem. The core software needs to be modified to accommodate for a rising increase in network transactions. Under the current one-megabyte-per-block limit, the network can only process around three transactions per second. If Bitcoin becomes a mainstream payment system, or even a platform for other types of transactions, it’s going to have to process much faster. Visa, by comparison, says its network can process more than 24,000 transactions per second. If left unchanged, it is projected that the Bitcoin wallet will cease to function properly sometime next year. The “Real” Problem The real problem facing the five core bitcoin developers is how to update the software without revealing the nature of their totalitarian rule. Bitcoin is advertised as open source software, decentralized, and not subject to manipulation or adjustable inflation like its big fiat brothers. But in reality the currency’s control is centralized to these five. When the Federal Reserve decides to make adjustments, the Federal Open Market Committee , the group in charge of overseeing the growth of the United States money supply, must reach a consensus of twelve members. Bitcoin on the other hand is controlled by just five. But how did a currency like bitcoin, that’s advertised as a solution to government controlled fiat, become more centralized than the Federal Reserve itself? This isn’t something that’s talked about in bitcoin circles and the mention of the word centralization can result in “bad things happening” to outspoken community critics. Long-Term Solution Thankfully, there are alternatives to the bitcoin, and many experts believe the next wave of the cryptocurrency boom will originate with these developing projects that have bright young talent with increasingly open minds. Projects like Litecoin (LTC), the original scrypt coin with faster confirmations than bitcoin, Peercoin (PPC), the original hybrid POW/POS coin, and of course Goldcoin (GLD), the coin that invented the original 51% attack defense. These three are some of our top picks, but there are hundreds of others striving to climb into the crypto saddle and race the good race. So while Bitcoin might be the home of power-tripping insiders, there’s a war being waged on the digital currency scene and it’s only just beginning. There’s an entire sea of cryptocurrencies swelling to the surface, and now that the cat’s out of the bag, it might just be time for the real slim shady to please stand up.

The guy the wrote the book that this even was promoting (popper) calls it a spreadsheet in the sky, Gavin calls it digital cash and the Fred Wilson talks about the underlying technology. Andrew the host asked how do you get bitcoin, he was hinting at mining but Gavin said you have to buy it or earn just like you would with fiat money. Then they discussed the libertarian view of bitcoin and if that was meant to be when bitcoin was created it or if libertarians are the ones who adopted it. Then onto illegal transactions, silk road etc. Somewhere along the line some one blurted out 51% attack which sent the whole interview on a tangent about the fork in 2013 and the host Andrew seemed convinced that it was possible to be sold/receive ""fake bitcoin"" (bitcoin from a off chain, not the main accepted chain). I'm surprised Gavin didn't voice up and explain more about this. Then they started to speculate and discuss the future of bitcoin and how it will fit into the world. Fred seems convinced that banks and credit cards will adopt the blockchain for transactions. Gavin gave a good explanation that bitcoin isn't something that you can ""pigeon hole"" into something we all know today. When automobiles came out they were called horseless-carriages, because all they knew were carriages and horses and it was ""pigeon holed"" into this category. Then they went onto to discussing the price, not much insight here. Who is satoshi talk... Is bitcoin just for illegal transactions, etc... and that illicit use was part of the rise of bitcoins value. Then discussion of Lazlo and his 10,000 BTC pizza. Fred admitted to owning between 500 - 2000 bitcoin. Gavin says he owns ""some bitcoin"" Then they went on to bitcoin the currency vs the blockchain technology. Then they took questions from the audience, like what CANT you do with bitcoin, whyy will miners still mine after 2140 when no more block reward.

Last week Nasdaq announced plans to use Bitcoin's blockchain – a real-time public ledger of transactions – with the exchange's private markets platform, designated for firms preparing for initial public offerings. Users will be able to issue and transfer securities on the blockchain via the Open Assets protocol, which uses specific units of bitcoin as tokens to represent ownership of equity shares or other assets. These tokens are referred to as ""colored coins."" If all goes well, Nasdaq may expand its use of blockchain technology to other businesses, including its central counterparty clearinghouses and central security depositories, according to a person familiar with the company's thinking. The shift to the blockchain represents a leap into the digital age for Nasdaq. Most stock exchanges use an outdated record-keeping system that relies on paper certificates. Bitcoin's distributed ledger will improve the auditability of Nasdaq's records and allow officials to keep better track of ownership of assets as they change hands, according to the person familiar with the decision. Nasdaq is far from the only big-name firm to proclaim interest in using distributed-ledger technology to facilitate speedier, cheaper and more auditable transactions. But financial firms have typically dismissed Bitcoin itself as too risky for mainstream use. Cryptocurrency researcher Tim Swanson explained this hesitancy in a report earlier this year, writing that banks were unlikely to adopt Bitcoin's ""permissionless ledger"" because the anonymity of blockchain users would make it hard to hold anyone accountable in instances of fraud or other transactions gone awry. But now the financial industry has a ""brand-name firm experimenting for real"" with the Bitcoin blockchain, as Richard Gendal Brown, IBM UK's executive architect for innovation in banking and financial markets, wrote in a blog post last week. Nasdaq's move lends credence to the idea of using ""the inherent security and open-access of the Bitcoin system to 'carry' representations of real-world assets,"" Brown wrote. ""Dismissing [Bitcoin] entirely could be a big mistake."" ..... more http://www.americanbanker.com/news/bank-technology/nasdaq-signals-confidence-in-bitcoin-not-just-the-blockchain-1074405-1.html",692,Sr. Member,galdur,19:31:37,2015-05-20,322,670,1,NYSE launches a bitcoin index

The new stock exchange could sidestep traditional stock exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ and issue corporate stock directly over the Internet. In a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 24, Overstock indicated that it may issue up to $500 million in stock or other securities through an alternative trading system built upon blockchain technology that powers bitcoin. Overstock’s CEO Patrick Byrne is confident that the SEC will approve the filing eventually: “I wouldn’t have taken all the time and trouble and expense to do this if I didn’t plan on using it someday soon,” he told Wired. ... more https://bitcoinmagazine.com/20482/overstock-purchases-stake-stock-brokerage-firm-upcoming-blockchain-based-securities-exchange/",693,Sr. Member,galdur,19:40:53,2015-05-20,322,670,1,NYSE launches a bitcoin index

Yeah some of it is sidechains... buts it's better just to think of them as accountability ledgers... you know they just reference each other like receipts or have internal accounting systems inside the ledger or when someone registers in a different jurisdiction. It's really simple to apply to the blockchain, when I realized what it is, not to deprecate it's value, but it's incredibly secure; there is a lot of different types of data that can be securely accounted for at all times securely and at minimal cost. I'm thinking of the most important data that we have, our credentials, associations, appointments, etc can be cross linked using blockchains. The big blockchains are able to secure data extremely well, regardless of what it is, but simply pegging a hash of another blockchain through the Bitcoin Blockchain can secure a smaller chain of limited size. The hashes embedded in the Bitcoin transaction would carry the hash of that blockchain with the latest hash of it's next transactions pending transcription in the sidechain. Some blockchains may be amalgamations of several blockchains working in sequence to secure it's own transactions through multiple blockchains. Merge-mining multiple blockchains, embedding blockchain hashes across multiple chains, etc. Others may only exist inside another blockchain, referencing themselves through magnet-links to the blocks that constitute it's chain on the torrent network. reconstructing it's structure simply by tree-hashing up the chain. And yet others may exist simply by jumping from one Blockchain to another, barely present only leaving the embedded source of where they came from using public key cryptography to secure it's path forward. The more complex forms would link secure information across multiple Data Silo blockchains, cross referencing each other through smart contracts and linking new transactions through the most secure networks: Bitcoin,Litecoin, Peercoin,etc. Even going further forming sub-connected chains of increasing complexity... chains within chains within chains. Using Homomorphic encryption techniques would carry it even further forming compute structures openly available but securely accessible to key parties.  given the security of Blockchain ledgers and how ledgers cross link each other in the real world, with the addition of cryptography... this opens an incredible swath of society to a lot of opportunities in the most efficient manner possible. Just imagine a world where key news information could be transcribed openly in a secure manner onto a global Blockchain, that could easily disseminate to multiple channels across the planet at minimal cost without the use of complex datacenters... just a blockchain, a fee and secure awareness the news is going to reach it's destination no matter what for the whole world to se registries cross referenced across the globe, so there are no hassles... your information follows you where you go ready to prove whatever you have to prove at a moments notice.

24,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1066467.0,17,498,Pathi,"Create backups on a regular basis.  At least every 100 transactions, preferably more frequently than that.  Store at least one recent backup in a secure location that is not in the same building as the Bitcoin-qt wallet. Recover your most recent good backup: If the new wallet has no bitcoins and you haven't given any of its addresses to anyone, then replace the %APPDATA%\Bitcoin\wallet.dat file with your backup If you have already made use of the new wallet, then you'll need to come up with a plan to maintain both wallets or to merge them by importing the necessary private keys from one into the other. I'd be a bit concerned about Windows creating a backup while the file was in the process of being updated.  This could potentially leave it in an unusable state.  Windows backup is probably fine, but personally, I'd use the ""Backup Wallet"" function built into the wallet on a regular basis. It is a bad idea to try to run multiple instances of a single Bitcoin Core wallet right now.  They aren't designed for that and, if you don't know exactly what you're doing and how to manually synchronize the wallet data between them they will eventually get out of sync.  This will cause unusual and unexpected behavior, which is likely to lead to mistakes that will result in permanent loss of bitcoins. Only if you have all the private keys to all the addresses that have any bitcoins associated with them.  Bitcoin-qt (also known as Bitcoin Core) creates random new private keys and addresses for you without telling you about them every time you send a transaction.  If you don't have the private keys to those additional addresses, then you will not have access to much of your bitcoins. The wallet backup handles this by pre-generating the next 100 addresses that the wallet will use any time the wallet is unlocked.  Therefore, the 100 addresses used after a backup (and the associated private keys) are included in the backup. This is why I suggest creating a new backup AT LEAST every 100 transactions.  Since it is possible to lose a backup, for a backup to become damaged, or for you to lose track of how many transactions you've done since the last backup, it is better to create backups more often than that and the keep the most recent few.",705,Legendary,DannyHamilton,14:54:44,2015-05-20,1106,666,1,Disaster recovery discussion.

I've got Windows 7 pro 64bit but for some reason only 32bit Java and am too jittery to move to 64bit because I don't know what it's ll do to my computer and my understanding is it's important for me to have 64bit Java to get certain programs to run in the cryptosphere. I did manage to get a wallet from blockchain.info and create an address to receive btc, I used what I believe to be a strong password but I still don't bother backing my wallet up. I'm afraid I'd mess it up. They keep asking me to improve my security by giving my phone number but that makes me nervous too. Still I was able to open an account at Poloniex a couple of weeks ago, take a couple of positions that seem to me to be promising but still I'm worried that my limited knowledge about computers in general is keeping me shy of getting more involved in this new economy. I can afford to lose what I'm playing with now but taking a long position with an eye to a set goal of gains makes the play rather boring now. I'd like to get a better understanding through hands on experience so I'm ready to input more fiat. I just wonder where there might be a place where I can learn the basics of securing my wallet(s), for now I'm comfortable writing everything down on paper, then I backup by taking pictures of both my computer screen as well as my keys (identifiers?) and passwords on an old smartphone that is no longer being used for other purposes. So do I need to update to Java 64bit? And how do I get a password generator from the internet to my old phone. I do have the old desktop version for syncing and upgrades for the phone. Can I safely transfer a password generator to my phone and then be able to use it without service or connection to the internet? Is this a viable air gap? I don't have a second laptop. I don't know what PGP or GPG means but I still don't want to wreck my computer until I find a decent tower unit that can more easily be upgraded so I can eventually support the network. After I learn enough to be a benefit to the network rather than little more than the curious child I feel now. Thanks in advance for any help with my situation.

25,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1067079.0,17,539,fwinoker,"It wouldn't hurt to update to 64 bit Java. A lot of websites use java to do things, and 64 bit is generally better than 32 bit. There are no negative effects of upgrading. There isn't much to mess up with a wallet backup, especially on a web wallet. All that happens is you download a copy of your wallet, it won't effect your wallet's balance or anything unless someone steals it. Even then, you can still get an encrypted backup which is decrypted upon upload to their site for a restore if you wish to do so. Since it is a web wallet, a backup is not necessary, since they probably also back everything up and if their servers crash, they are liable and should reimburse you for any loss. Why are you nervous about giving them your phone number for extra security? 2 factor authentication makes everything much more secure as a hacker who steals your password still cannot get into your account unless he also stole your phone. I suppose that is ok. You should download encrypted backups of your wallet, and keep multiple copies of it in different places. Perhaps one on your computer, another on a flash drive, and a third on your old phone. You should also create a paper wallet, there should be an option for this in blockchain.info. You print out the paper wallet and put it in a safe deposit box at the bank. These are the normal tactics of keeping your Bitcoin secure. Why would you need a password generator? You should be able to download an app and transfer it to your phone to install it, depending on the phone. The app should never access the internet and be done completely offline. This is a viable air gap, but why would you need it? PGP is an encryption system, unrelated to the functioning of Bitcoin. It is similar to Bitcoin, in that it uses public key cryptography. PGP can be used to verify that someone is who they claim they are by creating a signed message which can be verified. It is also used to encrypt and decrypt messages so that certain information can be kept private.

I will check out upgrading to Java 64bit. Last time I downloaded it I couldn't bring myself to press accept. I'm beginning to think I'm overly cautious in this regard. Still pretty cautious about clicking on random links. I finally got rid of my Avast and just going with Windows firewall and defender...my computer runs much smother without all the bundled pups and other crud that comes with the freeware. It's good to know that the wallet at blockchain.info is backed up by them. I do have the authenticator and my password written down. I haven't risked enough to worry about cold storage and for me to backup the blockchain.info wallet I believe required me to use a usb or disc and the 2FA I can't remember if that's the square image that I take a picture of with my smartphone or it's through Google+ but I don't think I'm comfortable with using my active phone at this time. In time I no doubt will have little choice if I want to keep an eye on my assets. I am aware of the printing of a paper wallet but have no printer and I'm still a bit lost on the airgapping a printer thing. Hopefully my current security is sufficient for present purposes. Again, still climbing that learning curve. As to a password generator it is my understanding that one can create a unique cryptic password from a picture of something as simple as a tree or cloud formations. I was thinking I could download something to my old smartphone (Storm 2) and take some pictures then create a suite of private keys and public passwords for future use. Maybe I'm over thinking all of this. Ah...GPG...I've seen that a few times in some of my meanderings in this site. A trusted escrow would have one, although I've used escrow here and they did have that, it's certainly not the deciding factor in judging trust.

EDIT: Found it: http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=929196 I wonder what would happen if it was discovered that addresses could be stolen in this manner? Probably some kind of emergency hard fork would have to be done before the damage has a chance to spread. There would need to be a rollback of any transactions too. Or a weak RNG. Japan went from literally nothing to being a major superpower not only once but twice during it's history. It's possible that China could do the same. I don't think it's possible to deduce a private key from a public key. It does weaken the security since it strips away an additional layer of encryption but not to the point where an address could be compromised. An altcoin that rewards those who submit shares to a decentralized effort to crack Satoshi's wallets? That doesn't sound all that different from what Primecoin/Riecoin/Curecoin/Gridcoin/Foldingcoin are doing so it might just be possible. It would be completely pointless though for reasons that have already been mentioned many times in this thread. If the software is available for public download then it should be easy to confirm whether or not it's a virus.,830,Full Member,Mt.

Quantum computers could shorten the time required to break SHA-256. Computers 10,000 years in the future could be using exotic materials and technologies that we don't yet know about or even begin to comprehend. Perhaps, but having half of a private key actually shortens the entropy significantly. It would take not half as long to crack but something like millions of times less. It's probably irrelevant still, but it's something to consider when dealing with similar situations (e.g. a 12 word Electrum seed where you know the first 6 words is much easier to crack than a typical seed). This is possible. Mycelium had a similar flaw at one stage. You're right about the 50 BTC thing. He has many addresses scattered all over the blockchain with each address containing 50 BTC (plus any fees). From what I've read, the most commonly accepted figure is 1 million BTC. Most of that would have been from mining in 2009 when virtually nobody else was mining (other than a few very early adopters like Hal Finney). 2 million BTC seems a bit high IMO but if he continued mining all the way up until now and changed his practice of not consolidating coins in order to remain undetectable then it might just be possible. If it's revealed that they actually managed to match up one of Satoshi's confirmed addresses with a private key then it's probably not a good idea to dismiss it as a fluke. Since the chances of such a thing happening are so vanishingly small, it would be more reasonable to assume that there is something much larger and more significant at play (most likely it would be an undocumented flaw in SHA-256 or an implementation of it).",840,Sr. Member,Lorenzo,11:03:59,2015-05-04,350,676,4,Chinese team released software to mine Satoshi's coin

And even then, your miner would break and the earth would get swallowed up by the sun before you found a private key corresponding to one of Satoshi's addresses (which only contain 50 BTC since he never consolidated his coins into one single large address like most others). You could, but it's so highly improbable that it's not really worth thinking about. So far, private keys that have been brute forced almost always corresponded to weak brainwallets. And directory.io hasn't really posted a ""list"" of addresses and private keys. Instead, it just generates them on the fly. EDIT: I see odolvlobo has already mentioned this. It caused quite a big scare when it was first made public though! Someone posted the link with the title ""Bitcoin has been hacked"" which caused some people to panic at the time.

If later you moved to abroad and invest/consume your bitcoins, I guess that country will not try to tax you, since for that country the foreign capital injection is always a benefit, if you try to tax them they will never arrive Unlike other assets (stocks/bonds/real estates), which can only be traded on domestic exchanges and be taxed accordingly, if you want to tax bitcoin, you must tax it before the people leave the boarder, but that is not OK because at that time the coins have not been exchanged into any other currency thus does not generate any taxable event So maybe it is not right to classify bitcoin as asset, an asset without boarder is in fact physically non-taxable I have this question when I just went through an old report that swedish bailiff are trying to find people evading tax with hidden bitcoins   http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1646&artikel=5983956",898,Legendary,johnyj,02:18:20,2015-05-21,1428,659,1,A tax question about bitcoin as asset
