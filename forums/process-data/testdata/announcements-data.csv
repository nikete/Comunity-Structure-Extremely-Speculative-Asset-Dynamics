444,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=842240.0,1,72739,QuicksilverCoin,"T he concept of empowering individuals through the decentralization of communications, networks, and markets is why Quicksilver is committed to improving and implementing new ways for people to use the blockchain technology. The goal of QuickSilver is to decentralize the process of acquiring and paying for a cab.  A robust driver and customer matching system includes everyone from independent cab drivers to fleet owners allowing everyone to compete in the market.  There are no hidden fees when using QuickSilver which will translate into lower prices for customers and a better bottom line for drivers.  We are focusing on implementing an elaborate rating and reputation system in order to build a trusted and secure network of drivers and customers. Attention to employment and responsibility within the Quicksilver network is in focus. The trust rating service will pull verified ratings from other Cab hailing apps such as Sidecar, Lyft, Uber and Postmates. Allowing trusted drivers to carry their portfolio forward into the network. Cashless transactions are introduced as both drivers and riders receive private key coupled accounts. Following a pricing scheme similar to taximeter, price rates are determined in QSLV/min or QSLV/km. The ability to split fare prices has also been created as users are able invite friends to opt in to split costs. Quicksilver invites not only private cab drivers but also extends its hand to commercial companies in order to create its free market. Giving the flexibility to customers to choose between well-established standards at premium rates or private drivers within budget with excellent trust rating. The free market aims to deliver competitive prices with peace of mind for its customers as drivers should to aim to build and maintain trust ratings to attract custom. QSLV is a proof-of-stake (POS) coin. POS is the fastest and most efficient for users to generate new blocks on the network. Users only need to purchase coins on a cryptocurrenty exchange and transfer them to their personal wallet.  Additionally, we are aiming to implement a simple and integrated gateway for the users of the coin to obtain and sell QSLV.

The primary mission of this coin and its team is to secure our investors funds through our various pathways in investment. We are dedicated to establish a Cryptocurrency allowing our initial investors to be well rewarded for trusting us. Ensuring a constant revenue for our shareholders will be our fist and foremost task in this project. Our IPO investors will share the profits from our investment in cloud mining, purchasing mining rigs, merchandise, and business entities.

(The share from the 30% btc payout) Main Idea The main idea behind this coin is to provide a winning situation for all of the holders. Most of the coins out there are mostly created to be pumped and eventually dumped but we are here to take the cryptocurrency world to another level. We have decided to make it more than a simple currency by making this coin a real revenue coin. While we provide many sources of revenues and more solid features along the way, you will notice the difference between ErmisCoin and all the other Cryptocoins. People are not going to be holding ErmisCoin simply to catch a pump and dump wave, but they will be holding it with the potential of sharing revenues which will be constantly growing as Ermis network grows. ErmisCoin is created as a revenue generating company. With every company the start is always a bit hard but please bear with us and we will show you how powerful our system is made to be!

1424,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=785257.0,5,107888,The SolarCoin Foundation,"SolarCoin (SLR) The only digital Proof of Work/Proof of Stake currency to date with a Solar Proof of Generation mechanism that grants SolarCoin to generators of clean renewable solar energy! SolarCoin is an alternative digital currency with a built-in mechanism to incentivize the generation of global solar electricity. By simply mining until the PoW phase is complete and then staking SolarCoin holdings once 100% PoS is triggered while also exchanging SolarCoin (via real world use or trading on an exchange) just as you would any other digital currency, you are contributing to the development of clean renewable solar energy! Solar energy, unlike fossil fuels, does not place excess heat or carbon into the atmosphere. The creation of new renewable energy resources by SolarCoin results in a nearly carbon neutral mining footprint via the 100% Proof of Stake mechanism being created to secure the network. §1 = 1 MWh is the key ingredient of the SolarCoin vision. In economics, this is called parity . It is the foundation of a global currency that can provide both economic utility (backed by electricity production as a commodity) and economic stability (electricity generation is tied very closely to GDP growth historically). The value of SolarCoin in the future will be directly related to the value placed on generating 1 MWh of solar electricity which has the same utility no matter where in the world it is produced. Please read the white paper written by the two co-founders for more detail on this economic aspect of the SolarCoin model. SolarCoin will be a Proof of Stake based alternative digital currency modelled after BlackCoin. This hashing method is designed to secure and reward a community of holders who support the SolarCoin vision. But SolarCoin's true innovation comes from its secondary proof of work reward: the Solar Proof of Generation . Green solar energy producers are entitled to receive one SLR for every MWh of solar electricity they generate: §1 = 1 MWh. In order to claim a Solar Proof of Generation reward, solar installation owners must submit an application to The SolarCoin Foundation identifying the nameplate capacity of their system along with their geographic location. Using this information, a 15% formula is applied and SolarCoin is granted to the generator automatically every six months on the anniversary of their application. All Solar Proof of Generation rewards will be stored as transactions in the blockchain. As an example, a 10 kW solar installation will earn §11.5 per year or approximately §1 per month, to be paid out automatically every six months. This is a temporary granting method until such time as the technology improves to the point that the grants can be made completely autonomous and fully decentralized, preferably through a decentralized contracting system similar to BlackHalo (or some other model). The goal and vision for SolarCoin in the future is to become a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). SolarCoin is currently managed as an open community project by volunteers working together as The SolarCoin Foundation. The Foundation is responsible for all distribution of SLR rewards for the Solar Proof of Generation and other grants (i.e. charities, bounties, etc..). As a fully transparent organization the Foundation will publicly document all of the SolarCoin transactions in their entirety via a public ledger and the SolarCoin blockchain. The total supply of SolarCoin in circulation will be approximately §98.1 billion over the next 40 years. This is fully documented and is comprised of the following: Public Staking and Mining : ~§100 million (0.1%) of which §33.3 Million are publicly mined using scrypt PoW until such time that the Proof of Stake algorithm is implemented. All publicly mined SolarCoins represent historically generated and unclaimed solar electricity. From block 357,520 forward, the only new supply of coins will come from claimants supplemented by the PoW phase at §1/Block that will be in place until the PoS algorithm comes online and thereafter new supply comes at a rate of 1% staking interest that will be built into the PoS model. The Generator Pool : §97.5 billion (99.4%) are currently stored in a secure, non-circulating generator pool account. These will be exchanged for “proof of generation” claims of solar electricity producers submitted over the next 40 years at the rate of §1 per MWh of solar energy generated. As claims grow, these SolarCoins will be released and become part of the “coins in circulation” such that the growth in supply over the next 40 years should mimic the growth in solar electricity generation worldwide, assuming all generators claim their coins. The Genesis Pool : §500 million (0.5%) are stored in the genesis pool account for environmental charities, early volunteers, advisers, builders and maintainers of SolarCoin infrastructure. Genesis pool circulation is capped so that it will never represent more than 5% of total SolarCoin in circulation at any given time. The Foundation is currently organizing its initial charter and members; anyone can join and participate .

Original thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1042217.0 Empyrean , from the Medieval Latin Empyreus , an adaptation of the Ancient Greek ἔμπυρος Empyrus ""in or on the fire (pyr)"" properly Empyrean Heaven, is the place in the highest heaven, which in ancient cosmologies was supposed to be occupied by the element of fire (or aether in Aristotle's natural philosophy). With a lot of coins in the crypto community the phrase “to the moon!” is used often half heartedly as a way for traders to try and hype a coin to make a little more profit. With Empyrean though we will be using the phrase “To Empyrean!” -  To the highest heavens! Because we believe the coin has the potential become one of the most widely adopted cryptocurrencies in the world today.

Please update your clients now!  Just click on the links below Kryptonite is a de-centralized virtual currency.  Kryptonite aims to benefit more than just the huge hashers out there - and we aim to be as fair as we can.  We're developing KRYP to be usable in as many places as possible, and make it easier for the masses to understand how to use it.  Unlike many before us, we do not go to any effort to hide our identities - we don't need to! We do not claim to have a coin with all the latest tech and gimmicks - in fact we take no shame in having a coin which yes, in many ways is like many others (for now, anyway).  The main difference between Kryptonite and other coins is it's fairly long maturity time of 3 days, and our (slightly) more unusual block reward system which aims to deter miners with huge hashing power.  We hope that this, along with us, the devs, being open and upfront about what we're doing, will help to make KRYP in to a strong contender in the virtual currency arena.  There is no rush to do this! We've now teamed up with PromoteYourCo.in who are holding our pre-mined coins for us, so that you the users, know that the coins are safe from dumping or theft.  More news coming REALLY soon, but we hope that our next release will be something that everyone, not just the tech/krypto savvy, will be able to make use of in a completely familiar way, and without having to learn anything - well, nearly! http://kryptonitecoin.info ______________________________________ 50,000,000 total coin supply 1 - 15 coins per block over about 7 years 31 second block time, 6 confirmation transactions Minted blocks mature in 3 days - 8283 blocks Diff updated every block using ONLY DGW3 X11 Algo for more security & more hashing for less power and heat ______________________________________ ______________________________________ Block Rewards: 1 KRYP 1st week Completed 5 KRYP over 1 month Completed 10 KRYP over 4 months Completed 15 KRYP over 9 months Currently Minting 10 KRYP over 1 year 5 KRYP until end of supply - about 4 years 10 months ______________________________________ ______________________________________ There was a pre-mine of K500,000 . It is already funding development and marketing, giveaways, bounties, draws, and random acts of kindness! The rest of the pre-mine has now been transferred to PromoteYourCo.in who are now holding ALL remaining pre-mined coins in Escrow - we've done this to show we're serious about not dumping the pre-mine - that we're going to use it as we've always planned. ______________________________________ Our pre-mine is held in Escrow with PromoteYourCo.in, who hold ALL remaining pre-mined coins - we've done this to show we're serious about not dumping the pre-mine, and that we're going to use it as we've always planned.

2405,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=491637.0,11,114519,SpartanCoin,"So I have been looking into escrow services and so far here are some issues. 1. Minimum BTC required. this may be minor if anyone interested in becoming a part of the project and would offer the minimum BTC depending on which service we work with. 2. If you invest in Spartan and escrow is established we cannot change terms. So if you invest more we need to make a separate escrow for each time you add more to your investment. 3. The escrow requires set amounts for the transaction. If an escrow of 1BTC for 1,000,000SPN we cannot change that. But each persons SPN amount is based on amount invested in relation to others and may fluctuate. So a fixed escrow will not work. 4. Distribution of SPN is daily for a period of 45 days. So total allotted in escrow wont happen for 45 days. I am not opposed to escrow but at the moment its a tad tricky to ensure this runs smooth. Any questions or suggestions I am always open to chat.",208,Sr. Member,SpartanCoin,18:23:15,2014-02-28,266,440,1,[ANN] SpartanCoin - Cryptocoin for the competitive world.

510,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=804288.0,15,48693,WhitecoinFoundation,"Latest Version: 1.1.2.2 WhiteCoin continues to evolve from its early days when it was originally created by a developer that only wanted to cash in to where it has flourished to become more than just a coin, WhiteCoin has grown into a truly innovative community consisting of Developers and Private Business Investors. While available to everyone, WhiteCoin is driven by a dedicated community of supporters yet controlled by no one single individual. This attractive combination will help ensure stability, growth, and compelling technological developments. WEBSITE - BLOG TWITTER - FACEBOOK - REDDIT - INSTAGRAM Block Time: 1.5 Minutes Difficulty Retarget: every block Confirmations on Transactions: 7 Confirmations on Mined Blocks: 350 Fees: Minimum transaction fee of 0.00005 WC Stake Interest: 2% annually                                       Scrypt Total Coins: 300,000,000 Block Reward: 30000 Total Blocks: 10000 POS After Block: 10000 Port 15814 RPC Port 15815 Features: Unique design Easy to use interface Create XWC accounts Multilanguage Built in block-explorer Network statistics Manage your contacts Windows / Mac / Linux           Bootstrap What is bootstrap.dat bootstrap.dat allows a new Whitecoin client (not synced) to rapidly import the initial blocks from a local file instead of slowly downloading blocks from random peers. This significantly reduces the time it takes to get a client synced with the current blockchain. Simply having bootstrap.dat in Whitecoin's expected data directory will make your initial block sync much faster. The import process can be even faster if you use the -dbcache=1000 command line parameter which uses an additional 1GB of RAM for the database index cache. How this works Download bootstrap.tgz from http://explorer.whitecoin.info/bootstrap/ Verify the integrity of bootstrap.tgz with the checksums. Decompress to obtain bootstrap.dat. Put it into the Whitecoin datadir. This is the same folder that contains wallet.dat and the blocks folder. or run the wallet with ""whitecoin-qt.exe -loadblock=c:\path_to\bootstrap.dat"" Delete bootstrap.dat.old if you want to recover some storage space.                         Windows         Mac         Ubuntu         Github WhiteOS utilizes a custom, optimized and hardened Ubuntu environment based on the latest version 14.04LTS.  WhiteOS is a secure and portable operating system that anyone with a PC or laptop will be able to use. Because the OS and Wallet data files are stored on a USB, you effectively have true cold storage, and your coins will follow you wherever you go. BUILT IN ANONYMITY - One of the most unique features of this secure environment is that the wallet and browsers are redirected through a TOR proxy to ensure anonymity and privacy (this runs locally by default). When you unplug your USB stick no trace is left on the host PC. A special thank to all the private and public  beta-testers (some who wished to remain anonymous)!!!  We have fixed many bugs that I would not have found on my own system. We are dedicated to make WhiteOS as feature rich and secure as possible.  Continued development on some really nice and unique features is under way and will be released in future versions.     What happens after the release of WhiteOS, we have some really nice unique ideas that we are willing to implement in future versions of WhiteOS, so we continue to develop on WhiteOS as a good and secure and portable OS. Once the release of WhiteOS is succesfull more features will be added Video preview: Screenshots: ﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Download: WhiteOS_0.2.3_x86_live.iso 1.10 GB - Mirror 1 (mega) WhiteOS_0.2.3_x64_live.iso 1.11 GB - Mirror 1 (mega) You can find more information and a small HOWTO here Update your previous WhiteOS versions with the latest wallet Open your terminal and copy paste the following lines one by one Code: cd ~ wget -q -O ~/whiteos_update_wallet.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oizopower/WhiteOS-update/master/update_latest_wallet.sh sudo chmod +x whiteos_update_wallet.sh sudo ./whiteos_update_wallet.sh Options to install: On USB so it's portable (main idea and easiest) Under windows (VMWare/Virtualbox (make sure to use PAE)/Hyper-V) (easy) Dual-boot next to windows (advanced) WhiteOS comes with a backup tool to remotely backup your wallet and home dir.

510,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=804288.0,15,48693,WhitecoinFoundation,"ISO compliant currency code: this has to be done eventually, once financial institutions and business start using cryptocurrency (such as currency exchange rates published in news, banks, price tickers, airline/train tickets, etc), they are going to use ISO compliant codes whether you like it or not. i'm reposting this from the old thread because i think it merits a further discussion: voice you opinion on this issue as community members, its in your hands, no one is going to decide for you, if there's no interest it just stays as it is. can we get a public voting on this going on whitecoin website? (not anonymous, and possibly requiring proof of owning whitecoins and have btctalk account that is at least 3 months old? to prevent fake votes) with options and explanation about advantages of having ISO standards compliant currency code this would be a good for inwallet voting with trusted user feature active proposed codes: 1. XWT - ISO compliant 2. XWH - ISO compliant 3. XAL - ISO compliant (latin variant, could be a good choice because it would put whitecoin at the top of ISO compliant currency/exchange ticker lists ) 4. WTC - not ISO compliant, also has negative USA stigma (world trade center) 5. WC - not ISO compliant, also has a negative EU/ASIA stigma (water closet) option 3. is another idea, seeing as GOLD has currency code as XAU (from latin ""Aurum"" for Gold) latin for white is ""Albus"" so another alternative would be XAL i'd recommend to not hesitate and prolong this too much because there's a limit on currency code availability (seeing its ""X + two letters"" thats about 600 possible variations). sources for reading about ISO currency code standards: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217 http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/currency_codes.htm here's original post with some of the discussion:",287,Full Member,grv,18:21:50,2014-09-30,216,600,1,"[ANN] (XWC) | WhiteCoin | NEWS: Foundation, investors, WhiteOS ☯ whitecoin.info"

This is achieved by allowing miners to participate in a fully decentralized cheat-proof voting process. The money supply still has a fixed upper-bound of 128M HVC. Intially Heavycoin starts with a zero block reward. The very first miners will have the first opportunity to solve blocks and vote on what the first democratically selected block reward should be. The first 100 blocks (3.3 hours) will decide the starting block reward. From then on, block reward voting will continue, but the votes are counted and averaged every 3600 blocks (5 days). How to vote Heavycoin is configured to mine and vote by default, with a default vote of 512 HVC. If you want to change your block reward vote then see the ""How to vote"" and ""RPC voting"" sections of our website (alternatively some information is provided below).  When mining is enabled, every time you mine a block your wallet will automatically cast a block reward vote. The Heavycoin network automatically averages these votes every 5 days (3600 blocks) and sets the new block reward accordingly. The block reward is the average of all 3600 votes over the previous voting period rounded to the nearest integer. Voting RPC interface: Bounties Thanks to the bounty phase, Heavycoin will start with enough funds to do some serious work in terms of branding, marketing and promotion. Here are some of the projects we will be rewarding early adopters and promoters for.  If you are interested, then please post to the forum and send a PM so we can confirm the details. 30,000 HVC - professional grade commercial art and logos (specific guidelines, logo competition) 50,000 HVC - professional grade promotional video explanation (specific guidelines apply) 100,000 HVC - first substaintial merchant to accept payments with Heavycoin (eg. big online retailer) 40,000 HVC - third merchant 10,000 HVC - fourth merchant 10,000 HVC - fifth merchant 50,000 HVC - first casino site (specific guidelines apply) 10,000 HVC - setup and maintenance of a dedicated Heavycoin forum 10,000 HVC - sign-up of the first Heavycoin exchange 30,000 HVC - first block explorer 10,000 HVC - second block explorer 10,000 HVC - third block explorer (in progress) 30,000 HVC - first mining pool 30,000 HVC - second mining pool 80,000 HVC - seed node servers (long-term) 10,000 HVC - first article published 10,000 HVC - second article published 10,000 HVC - technical article published (specific guidelines apply) 30,000 HVC - article at CoinDesk, Bitcoin Magazine, Forbes or Money Week (specific guidelines apply) Thousands more to be awarded to promotors on twitter, facebook and online forums.

There are billions of coins in the pool waiting for solar claimants over that 40 year period, and it even goes back 3 years right now for claims. The large solar farms can always claim tens of thousands of coins for 2012(?) to 2014 power production. That's several hundred thousand coins right there and more in the future.

1424,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=785257.1000,5,107888,The SolarCoin Foundation,"So you have done all the math for every possible claimant or I guess you just pool it? If the coins are never claimed then the disparity is shown in the market since they can be claimed later. So you always base your Market Cap on unclaimed coins and you also base their output prior to your coin's creation. While you give the same value to the PoW coins as you do the Claim coins. Using PoW means you use energy and do not create energy when creating coins, good thing there is only 200Mhash as it is low energy consumption. This was an oversight. So claim coins will be sold off to FIAT at a low price. Below 1MWh per coin. These claimants do not care what they sell at for free money. This will erode the value. Since you want to PEG the price at 1MWh per coin you would have to create a buy wall vs FIAT to sustain it. Otherwise it would not be equal in FIAT. Saying 1 Coin Equals 1MWh is only truthful when not compared to FIAT, but when you pay for a MWh how much does that cost and what can your market bear? Seeing that it will be rife with speculators and whales buying and selling it, the manipulation will be rampant. People wanting to get out of the market into FIAT will take losses to the manipulations making it impossible to equal 1MWh cost per coin per BitCoin value... since we know it will not cost more than 1MWh per coin, the price can only be eroded. Not to mention the people who got in on the PoW at 100 per block can manipulate the price also. So lets say on average a MWh costs $90 on the low end. In some US states it goes as high as $120 per MWh. The cost per coin right now is .00001788 x $232 per BitCoin equals $0.0041 per SLR Coin. This just proves my point. Each coin is not even worth half a penny yet 1 Coin = 1MWh. You don't even have the market cap of a Million AAA Energizer Batteries! So the price per coin should be around .388 per SLR coin to start with or slightly lower reflecting wholesale. So if you are expecting investors to pay for this type of market movement based on Claims made by companies who have already been paid for the power they produced, I have to admire your sense of greed not green.",379,Sr. Member,CryptoNick,16:08:44,2015-01-23,376,200,51,[ANN][SLR] SolarCoin | PoW to PoS v. 2.0 | Solar Proof of Generation (§1 = 1MWh)
1424,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=785257.1000,5,107888,The SolarCoin Foundation,"Hi just trying to clarify.  98B premine generating pool is non-circulating until claimed. The figure is an estimate of next 40 year generation/potential claim. As non-circulating it has no impact on value/money supply.   Market cap is defined as circulating coins. Claimed coins may or may not be sold directly for fiat or goods and services or held.  Claimed coins are considered circulating and thus add to the money supply with varying levels of activity.  There is no need for a buy wall or other market manipulation.  The coin represents a means of distributing currency to generators equitably that forms a marginal incentive at the price of the coin. SLR is not directly equivalent to the value of a MWh of power. Solarcoin derives its value like other forms of money from its economic utility. Please note there a mix of participants in SLR some are miners, some of have purchased using fiat etc. and some have claimed solarcoins.  Once a coin is released into circulation how and what it is traded for is up to the market. Note: the generator pool never sells solarcoins for fiat. To date it has only given solarcoins to claimants. The genesis pool has a 300k liability payable for development.

Gold is used in Electronics for its physical properties and in Processors. You can say people believe products are worth a certain amount and that makes the Gold appropriate to that amount, but it is not based on pure belief, since it is a finite resource that takes Energy to produce and Energy to transform. Even a Jeweler requires energy to transform it. Basing the economy of the coin on a DeKo is a good idea since it will always be worth what those relative costs are in the real world. But this always relates to FIAT since that is what is paid to create worth for a MWh. To take FIAT out of the equation and just say the coin is worth 1-1MWh won't get any traction since you have to be able to sell the coin for value based on that MWh. Why would people buy the coin just to keep it as though that idea creates value? Even backing with Claims to prove you paid coin for those Claims doesn't create value or make people want to buy a Solar Panel.

1424,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=785257.1000,5,107888,The SolarCoin Foundation,"The price was bought and sold today at $0.0041 and you are telling me it won't ever do that? How would a person selling for even $1.00 get their expected money out of the market ever? More claimants come forward and will sell their coins! They do not want to keep them. Then these sells are bought by the orders at .00001788 and only if there is demand for the coin will the price go up. So the Claimants have no stake in the coin or its success but the Households do. Holding a coin at this point and placing a value at close to the cost of MWh would mean you will be the last sale on the exchange when it takes place 40 years from now and it could be because you set that price at todays rates and eventually the market moved there due to inflation. An SLR is an SLR whether it is from a Household or Solar Farm or PoW. Meaning the credit pool is still there looming, even if the coins are never distributed people will be wary of this impending credit supply hitting the market and crashing it since we know, for a fact, 1 SLR will NEVER equal more than 1MWh. Where you buy in will only show how wise of an investment you made since you don't know if these pool credit coins will dump on your positions suddenly. Only after all pool credit coins have been credited can the monetary system stabilize. So if I buy 1,00,000 SLR for .0041 cents and the price goes up to .41 cents I sell off my SLR and create no worth but take money from the economy. Now imagine how many others would do the same. This is where the speculators manipulate and churn out earnings from your coin whether you like it or not! There is no benefit to keeping SLR for a long term, even if a merchant sells you something in SLR they have to equate the cost to FIAT and then pay for the cost of their goods in FIAT. They always have to get out and people have to want to get in for some reason. What good reason do you have for people to get in other than they already have Solar Panels? This is a closed economy.

Right now SLR is STILL yet another crypto. But the project is moving forward. PoW reward has been reduced 100 times already, and is about to end as soon as development of the PoS wallet is done (may be any moment). So the only ways people will be able to get more SLR from that moment on will be from their claims, from the exchange, from PoS staking. Last mined SLR piles are being sold on the exchange right now, and that's it! Most participants in the process until now are here to keep their SLR so that the project moves forward. Exchange traders - they will adjust to the market. And the market? The exchanges will eventually be a fraction of the goods & services market where SLR will be accepted. ""Why would people buy the coin just to keep it as though that idea creates value?"" - Well.... you may have to rethink your idea of Crypto altogether. I buy coins, or mine coins, or CLAIM coins, to be able to PAY with them (for services, for goods, for FIAT, for other coins). Now, taking FIAT out of the equation is what really does me ONLY good - and I know that since the first time I made a purchase, in crypto, online, no FIAT involved. FIAT is out there - let it be, will not take it out of the equation - just like USD and EUR and JPY and CHF etc. are out there, in the FIAT world. ""Even backing with Claims to prove you paid coin for those Claims doesn't create value or make people want to buy a Solar Panel."" - People now KNOW how much FIAT they invested to produce MWh from Solar. They now KNOW how much FIAT they are paid for 1MWh from Solar. Now they also start claiming their SLR. So what do they do - keep them? They want to spend them. Crypto ecosystem goes forward, fast. Merchants KNOW that - they feel it! Solar Panel stores WILL start accepting SLR payments as soon as their customers request that. And the trade value of SLR? Well, I know both cost and sale price of 1MWh, right? And I do NOT want to spend FIAT any more, only SLR. Do you know why? See above. So how much is SLR? You know what? Really... I do NOT need to even know how much is 1MWH in FIAT any more! Got it? ""What good reason do you have for people to get in other than they already have Solar Panels? This is a closed economy. While my idea opens the economy and backs it with real money and encourages people to buy Solar Panels at a discount by using Solar Coins."" - Who says what will be ""real money"" in 1 year from now?

1424,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=785257.1000,5,107888,The SolarCoin Foundation,"I must say, this is a fascinating conversation. And timely! Especially since today is my one year anniversary for discovering SolarCoin. Reading through these comments is helping me to reflect why I am here supporting this endeavor. In a nutshell, I think Fiat and the current system are a failing system. I have held that view for a number of years as I see it deteriorate before my eyes, benefitting those at the top increasingly at the expense of just about everyone else. Fiat is necessary for now because that is how much of the world still functions. However, my belief is that 10 years from now, possibly even within five years or less, fiat will have a rude awakening. It's a MASSIVE bubble! Combined with an under estimation of the damage global warming will have and I happen to think a currency solution to address both problems is something we have to do for humanity so at least there is something for people to fall back on for trade purposes. 1 MWh of solar electricity, as they get dispersed into the economy through SolarCoin, is the best ""backing"" for a future currency that I can think of. I tend not to get stuck in thinking in terms of fiat for my ""investment"" in SLR. It's not about that for me, not even close. It's about creating a system from the ground up that can be used when the day comes that current systems no longer work for everyone. That day is already here for much of the world. My view of the future actually hasn't changed in the past year. If anything, the bust is moving even faster than I had anticipated. The difference between now and then is my perception of it. I choose to be hopeful rather than fearful. Could I be wrong? Absolutely. But what if I'm right? How do we want that world to work that isn't all about destruction and chaos? Call it pie in the sky if you want to, that's also a choice. For me, I prefer to focus on the solution rather than the problem. Will SLR be part of that solution? None of us know the answer to that yet, that's why it's called ""risk"". When it comes to understanding currency, I believe the Master says it best:",391,Sr. Member,Epiphany,11:47:03,2015-01-24,322,200,51,[ANN][SLR] SolarCoin | PoW to PoS v. 2.0 | Solar Proof of Generation (§1 = 1MWh)
1424,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=785257.1000,5,107888,The SolarCoin Foundation,"Love it! If you are not already afraid of the structure of the Fed Reserve and the 9 Trillion off the books during the Meltdown... ""You Will Be!"". I completely understand now that SLR is based off 1MWh but price doesn't mean anything externally other than what people are willing to trade for externally, right now .0041 cents. But that only matters to people who care about FIAT. Those who don't care, it is of no consequence. It is also a way to get into SLR cheaply from worthless FIAT. My only main concerns for Crypto in general and has nothing to do with SLR, is that the end game could be destruction of FIAT and its worth caused by Crypto as a self fulfilling prophecy. Either by State Sponsored subversion in order to attack other currencies using BitCoin or funnel funds to who knows where. The fact that the US decided to allow BitCoin only shows they are even worse than the criminals on SilkRoad which collected the majority of BitCoin for illegal activities. We have seen China take the precedent of only allowing the Selling of BitCoin and no buying. This is very telling. So when I comment on a coin it is only in hopes to benefit that coin and make it more viable. Making the Grid work for the people in FIAT and in SLR would create an equilibrium. Wouldn't it be amazing if participants in SLR could donate a percentage of the profits sent into to the grid, and were spent on an SLR public solar farm? Then the FIAT output of that farm goes into a buy wall of SLR. This would cause a pendulum swing as the output grows the farms could grow, even exponentially if proper percentages were agreed upon. SLR would be the most solvent currency ever created! Since it would equalize to FIAT and could maximize inside of the SLR economy knowing that the power feeds it externally also. Eventually SLR would transcend the risk entirely and make it a great investment since it only grows when it is fed. Ideally then SLR puts the Power Company on notice. All of the output of the farm would be public knowledge and the walls would shift to suit the proper pricing per MWh. The Solar Farm's could be a Co-Op to allow it to subsist legally within the endeavor of the Coin. All the coin bought from the buy wall could be burned as PoS also perpetuating the time value of the coin for the holders.

Well, being a one man band currently - I could do with help with near enough everything!  Any skills anyone has regarding cryptos would be helpful! Programming - c++ and QT especially, as this is something I've had to learn 'on the job' and is slowing me down - great designs and ideas in place - just taking much longer than planned to implement.  Also, anyone with projects like multiminers or anything else you might think of value to the project - KRYP would love you to be involved - we did have an offer, but it fell through. Marketing - spreading the word - jazzzy graphics/video Project planning - although I have experience, doing this (huge) project alone means I end up going with the flow, raqther than following my developments plans! KRYP is a long term project - value is slowly starting to rise to a point where we can start partnering with various sites to accept KRYP.  Anyone that wants to help with this aspect of the project would be good too. I think now that I find myself a one man band, I'm going to write some kind of white paper outlining my ideas.  This at the risk of those much more experienced than me taking those ideas, but a risk worth taking i'm sure. KRYP is not, and has never claimed to be any kind of fancy this or that currency.  What we're aiming for is something the average joe can a) get hold of easily without trading on exchanges, and b) use the currency to buy things - not other currencies. We (any of us) can give value to any currency we want if we want to.  There's no IPO and crash here - we've never asked for any investment.  The only true way to invest cash in KRYP, is to buy some!  Even you wheelers and dealers out there must realize that we're not getting anywhere with these quick listing and de-listings of currencies, after a few people make a bit more profit out of the ever dwindling real injection, of real value, into kryptos. So, the thing I'd really like the most, is for more of you who really want kryptos to work, to contribute not with cash (well, maybe a buy (and hang on to) a few KRYP), but with their knowledge, skills and ideas. I do have a plan in the works to make KRYP much more useable - for real things - you'll about that as soon as I catch up with everything! Sp please, even if you think your idea might not be great, or that you don't have any skills to contribute - have a good think, and let me know - only by working together, cooperating, and sharing ideas can we really move things forward. crakje@kryptonitecoin.info We do still have premine to donate to contributors, and I am what I have for the same purpose - so long as you guys don't go off and sell them in 5 mins for bugger all!  Think long term and you will make something!",421,Full Member,bigtop1967,23:13:11,2015-03-08,194,280,28,[ANN][KRYP] Kryptonite-X11 PoW DGW Landed 24th May 2014 @ 3.30pm BST

850,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=434432.820,14,57796,MrBrew,"I've gotten in contact with presstab and he quoted me his price and said it should be do-able. I am willing to pay him, to have this revival made possible, but it will require that enough people think me sane enough to follow my lead. So, this is where it gets interesting... explaining my plan of action. This coin will be a direct purchase currency.  Tea and herbal tea.  It has no BTC nor USD value (how can it, initially?).  It's base numeration is 10 coin for 1 teabag (sample).  Beyond that, it's whatever the seller and buyer (the ""market"") agree to.  This is where an equilibrium is established over time.  Shipping is also covered by an extra number of these coin (I'm thinking 100+), based on what the seller decides is fair compensation for shipping the product to the buyer (which is in USD/Euros, etc.), since they will use said coin to buy tea from someone else in the network.  If you do not like drinking tea/herbal tea, there is no reason to get involved.  Ideally, every seller should be a drinker, to make the most effective network.  Why hold coin you have no use for (i.e you don't like/drink tea) and hs no value outside of this specific network? The easiest way to make this network simple, is to have everyone grow/make their own herbal teas.  I grow lemongrass, mint, lavender, etc., which can all be used/blended to make herbal teas.  I will gladly be the first to ship a sample to anyone within the USA for 10 + 100 (110 total price) of said coin, when we get the network established and enough people on board to make this project viable. The idea is to have enough coins to exchange for product (tea), generated through communication and purchases, but not 10's or 100's of thousands or millions of them.  Being a Teacoin millionaire makes it difficult to establish value of the product.  This project is all about building a tight-knit community around this coin and enjoying each other's tea blends and talking about it.  Friendships, consumption, and communication.  That's what I want this coin to build. I seek to reestablish what Teacoin was MEANT to be used for, not what it became. My wife nearly dissuaded me from this project, stating the loss of Fiat to ship a product sold for Crypto (she, herself, would not get involved), but that's why I say everyone who sells should also be a drinker, because, that way you can USE the coin to buy tea.  If the ""loss"" of Fiat (to you) is greater than whatever value you would get out of this coin to buy tea (from another member) to drink, then this project is not viable for you. It is my belief, that once this revived network gets established and grows enough, outside people (exchanges, other tea dealers, etc.) may establish an ""outside value"" (BTC, Doge, Litecoin, etc.) and it will be worth something beyond it's original intent. But, even if it's ""outside value"" were to become monetarily worthless (as Teacoin has become, today), you would ALWAYS still be able to use it to buy tea and herbal teas from other people on the network. Teacoin would *NEVER AGAIN* be ever, truely worthless.  If you want tea... you like tea... you can always use your Teacoin to BUY tea.  It's purpose will never be lost because it had no value monetarily. Save your Fiat for something else... use Teacoin... TO BUY TEA!",504,Member,Luposian,08:25:51,2015-03-30,110,560,42,[ANN] TeaCoin [TEA] -@Bittrex - Fast - 0 Premine - 2.5% inflation

(or something similar).  Get a nice title cover, something similar to the original Teacoin page, but not exactly the same.  But it should look inviting and refreshing.  Glass of iced Hibiscus herbal tea, on a nice table setting or something... I need to get my Teacoin wallet up and synced.  Hope that doesn't take forever. Someone send me 1000 Teacoin.  I'll give you 4,000 Satoshi for them.  It's a penny ($0.01 USD) worth of Bitcoin, gained freely from Bitcoin faucets, so I'm more than glad to do it, to test out this idea.  I have some herbal tea ingredients already.  I can whip up a few teabags worth in the next few days, I'll be glad to sell for 10 (1 teabag worth) + 100 (shipping) Teacoin, to anyone in the USA. We all agree to set an exchange standard of 10 TEA for 1 teabag worth of product we sell, plus 100 TEA for shipping. We need sellers who are also buyers/drinkers.  Preferably herbal tea, made at home, using ANY ingredients that are safe for making herbal teas.  Test your product first, to make sure it actually tastes good.  You should, preferably, grow your own ingredients, to limit Fiat expense to just shipping the product to someone else.  Local (or relatively local) trade ranges should be established, to limit shipping expense.  Those in the EU trade amongst themselves.  Those in the USA, trade amongt themselves.  Unless someone ""across the pond"" has a formulation that is a ""MUST HAVE"" (by rabid recommendation, by lots of buyers!), then buyer/seller can arrange the coin price. If someone is familiar with making Facebook group pages, then they should be in charge of that.  We can all meet/talk there and use that as a place for brainstorming, sharing ideas, ingredients, formulations (generalized recipes (just a list of ingredients, no amounts)); don't want to give away any ""trade secrets"", tho.

850,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=434432.820,14,57796,MrBrew,"A good place to start is Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/tea There are over 55000 tea drinkers in that sub. Propose your idea there and see what sort of response you get. The rules don't seem to forbid it. It wouldn't hurt to throw around a few coins as tips. If you need some, send me your teacoin address. I can always mine some more. Edit: Just been thinking more about this. Perhaps we should agree on and publish a project roadmap so that all can see what's going to transpire. Then, we can go out and promote the project and gather bodies. It just lends credibility. That would involve a new thread here as well, one that you control. As for your 1000 coins, I think they are worthless but to lay the foundation for Teacoin 2.0. There are just too many old coins floating around out there to have any hope of price stability. My idea for the new wallet is to ignore old coins and have you, the developer, distribute 1000 new coins to the first 1000 members of the new Teacoin Club, a 1,000,000 coin ICO if you will. With a POS rate of 10-20%, that should compensate for growth and lost coins, and promote price stability and savings. I emphasize this because we'll need exchanges where vendors can monetize their coins. No one wants to worry about volatility or speculation, just how to pay bills. That's reality. You'll also inevitably need to buy more coins when your stash runs out. Until we have a full Teacoin ecosystem, we still need exchanges. Transaction fees and/or a stake fee could be coded to support wallet development and such. It should all be transparent. This definitely can work, as a gathering for acquaintances with a common love for tea, and as a place to do business in a specific product and with a super efficient global payment system.

In near future we first need to change something about the wallet, my head is full with all unique ideas for crypto and some include a later version of the bitcoin client. (e.g. leveldb, faster startup and so on). We are currently looking into the possibilities to update the wallet to the latest bitcoin client. But that will not be an easy task and the current team is still looking for a way to do that. Therefor we are looking for some more help in the development team, but those people are hard to find. And leaves us still looking I personally am still developing projects in my spare time for real world purchases and some other projects I prefer to keep silent for now (don’t like the idea that It will be hi-jacked). But anyway the current client needs a make-over. And maybe even in worst case scenario through a coin-swap (but those things are still on the drawing board as well, and will be announced properly so people are not being left behind). It seems that 1 developer has gone away without much saying so it’s only me and devoti0n in the dev team and Surfguy and Malbee and Jason still on PR side to fix things for us.

A strong and healthy network of nodes help spread the blockchain around the globe, and help keep the network healthy.   For those that don't know what Raspberry Pi is, it is a small linux computer which is about the size of a pack of playing cards and only costs around $40, plus the cost of an SD card. This instruction is to create a Whitecoin full node on a Raspberry Pi. You will need the following things before we start * Raspberry Pi Model B, B+, or 2 B * Minimum 8Gb class 10SD card, but I recommend a 16Gb Note: You may even get away with a 4GB card but I recommend against it * Monitor, keyboard and mouse to plug into the Pi for Initial setup (Not needed after setup is complete * You need to read up on your router and find out how to make it statically assign an IP address to the Raspberry Pi and how to set up port forwarding on it for both inbound and outbound traffic on port 9336 * You need to be able to SSH from your main computer to the PI to check it. If you have never done this before you will need to download and install Putty from here http://www.putty.org/ * To use Putty just start it and enter the IP address your router has assigned the Pi and make sure port 22 is entered into the port field * To work out what IP address your router has assigned the Pi you can either open up lxterminal when the pi first booted up and type in ifconfig and it will give you the Pi’s IP address or you can get this by logging into your router I will not go into the detail on how to do a standard install of Raspbian off Noobs as the Raspberry Pi website gives great instruction on how to do this. if you do not know where to download Noobs from you get it here. http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/ This link is to the howto to install Noobs onto the SD card http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/ The few extra things you should do over a standard install is * Change the password from the default password for extra security. * I also recommend doing minor overclocking to 800Mhz. * Don’t forget to enable SSH during setup * I recommend changing the memory split from 64 to only 32Meg for the video to give more memory to the CPU * Don’t forget to select your timezone * Consider changing the hostname if you already have more than one Pi on your network Set up Rasbian as per the instructions from the Raspberry Pi website and SSH into the Pi. Note as configured this script will download a precompiled version of whitecoind to save you 2 hours of compiling, if you want to compile it yourself uncommoment that section of the script and comment out the bit that downloads the precompiled one. To Download everything off github onto your Pi use the following command git clone https://github.com/Oizopower/XWC_Raspberry_Pi_Full_Node Now enter the directory XWC_Raspberry_Pi_Full_Node cd XWC_Raspberry_Pi_Full_Node/ We now need to make the script executable by typing sudo chmod 755 whitecoind_node_precompiled.sh Now we need to start the install script by typing. ./whitecoind_node_precompiled.sh This will * Update the Pi to the latest version * Install needed applications to run whitecoind, * Set up a firewall, that will allow ssh in and whitecoind to talk to other clients * Download whitecoind * Create a conf file with input from you to select a password for RDC * Download a fairly recent blockchain and chainstate to speed up the process of getting it running * create an /etc/init.d entry to start whitecoind as using ‘pi’ at boot You are now on the home stretch. You now need to log into your router and statically assign the IP address to the Pi and enable port forwarding to this IP address both inbound and outbound on port 15814. You will need to read your router's manual to find out how to do this. Once you have set up your router its time to test it.

Have so much owners that not make a profit of 170+BTC and care for their coins. For only 1 btc he can hire some developer that make things works.

Heavycoin introduces the HEFTY1 cryptographic hash function in order to thwart GPU and ASIC miners by breaking out of the SIMD paradigm. The machine instructions that comprise HEFTY1 vary depending on input data. That is, the particular instructions that are executed will not be the same for each hash guess. Thus, it impossible for a GPU or ASIC to have an advantage over a CPU. HEFTY1 must thwart GPU and ASIC miners while also providing secure cryptographic hashing. To this end, HEFTY1 was carefully constructed by making a minimalistic extension to SHA-256's Merkle–Damgård construction and experimentally validating it against FIPS 140-2 and the Dieharder statistical test suite U can check the code on github (if u can read it) if u dont believe.   sentence is true different algo",591,Full Member,eightspaces,09:41:18,2014-03-09,126,680,49,"[ANN] [HVC] Heavycoin - Ultra-secure, Decentralized Block Reward Voting, Fast"

From the last couple of pages, it also seems as if the bot nets / big whales have gobbled up this one (expect impending big dumps) rendering the whole decentralized feature pretty much useless.  The IPO investors are the victims here as the writing is on the wall for this coin and the sad part is the developers are probably on to their next IPO scam using a completely different user name.   We seriously need more transparency into the identities of coin developers so that we're not blindly trusting greedy people with our hard earned money that are just going to go around and copy and paste code and move on to the next dump (I hear the reason why these developers took 2 hours to launch was because they kept failing at ""anonymously"" uploading the non functional wallets which goes to show you how much faith they have in their own coin).",630,Member,Revelations86,06:44:21,2014-03-09,98,680,47,"[ANN] [HVC] Heavycoin - Ultra-secure, Decentralized Block Reward Voting, Fast"

6122,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=506774.760,17,275785,keccak512,Hmm I thought only the heavy hash rate miners are sucking up HVCs at the moment as there are still no pools for people with less opportunities in terms of hardware. And even when there are more mined HVCs than those from the IPO the miners always want the highest reward they can get. Only those who invested in the IPO want to limit the new supply with a reward amount of 1. I guess you and a couple other guys here belong to the latter group and want the price to rise. Fair enough though. That being said I'm out. Wish you all the best and a good RoI.

The way i see it is, if we vote low right now, there's less coins on the market. Coins are near-impossible to get yet , due to only solo-mining being available. This means there's less coins on the market, less competition for the IPO'ers who are practically the only ones able to trade so far (aside from a handful of lucky miners). Whereas if we vote HIGH, those ""lucky"" ones will bring more coins to the market and dilute the IPO-lead market. Though either way, i believe that low or high won't matter in the long run, unless we are swinging it back and forth weekly/monthly to our advantage. My 'vote high' is just my reasoning for the present time. Kind of in line with the guy above who said ""first let's get more coins""... just my thoughts on how to bring the market in to a more miner-favouring state.

Therefore, there will be multiple blockchains that are separate and at the same time somewhat intertwined. This is not the same as having multiple alts as clusters are geo-IP targeted, i.e. with a specific IP you will be connected to the geo-IP targeted cluster and there will be no possibility to choose a cluster to which you want to be connected. It is similar to some extant how wireless carriers are operating. Cross-cluster transactions (from cluster A to cluster B) will not flow quickly as they will be served by sync blocks. However, there is no need to be connected to cluster B to send transaction to cluster B.  Banking system is a complex system and some parts are working pretty well, others are bloated with regulation (capital adequacy, M2, collateral etc.). We think that payments systems are executed pretty well in banking and this is the part of banking that we are looking at.

Transferring funds across clusters might take longer, but we don’t see this as a problem.  Current financial system works in a similar vein and we used it as a model for ClusterCoin.  Analog of a cluster would be a network of local banks (local payments are processed by local banks with a prompt transaction); across cluster transactions (served by sync blocks) correspond to SWIFT transactions. Regarding fork risk of sync blocks – it is not clear that these blocks (which contain more transactions than an average block) pose more risk than any other block. What are you basing your claims on? I am sorry for this confusion; this was the part of old FAQ which was corrected in the White Paper but not in the thread. Sync blocks will be reward with a higher reward rather than zero reward. Sync block reward is still an open question in terms of how much rewarding it should be relative to a regular block.   Clusters will not be managed by a central authority but rather by wallets themselves. Whether or not a cluster should be generated will be based on a voting by miners/pools.

991,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=737636.120,80,34186,Essex343,"From your ANN I assumed the syncing was needed to make sure the clusters all have the same blockchain data: ""each cluster will process transactions independently and then periodically synchronize transactions between geographic clusters."" That sounds like each cluster will do transactions in their specific geo-location and then sync that data with other clusters to make sure all data is available and correct at all clusters. However now you seem to be saying that each geographical location will have its own blockchain and  sync blocks are only needed if one person travels from one geographical location to another, sort of how cell phone signal gets passed from base station to base station if you have a cell phone call while in a moving car. I am not seeing where the decrease in block confirmation time will occur then. If I introduce a different altcoin into each geo-location, they will have separate block chains and their confirmation times will be small only because I have limited who can be on that blockchain by geography. If I want the transaction data from another geo-location I would then have to search numerous blockchains, not just one. Also if one cluster is taken down for some reason the transaction data stored in that cluster will be lost. In fact you have similar points of failure and loss of data all over your network of blockchains. I happened to note you compared your coin to the modern banking system, one of the most centralized institutions we have. My ccomparison to wireless carriers is apt because somewhere in your coin's code you will need to have a list of clusters mapped to their associated geographical locations in order to be able to sync someone's transaction correctly to the correct cluster as they move from one geo-location to another. This is currently how cell phone towers work. That mapping is the holy grail for every surveillance agency out in the world today. With it they can track the geographical location where a certain transaction took place. You may argue that each cluster covers a large geographical area. This may be true at first but the more clusters that are set up, the less people will be covered by each individual cluster making it easy for data mining algorithms to find what they need.",1000105,Jr. Member,dijclarwin,21:10:22,2014-08-17,48,3183,7,☷[ANN]☷BITTREX ICO☷ CLSTR ☷ ClusterCoin ☷ the Future of Money ☷ SOLD OUT!

991,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=737636.100,80,34186,Essex343,"I am trying to understand the innovation this coin brings but having some trouble. You are essentially creating centralized points (clusters) from which to source the blockchain according to geographic location in order to speed up block confirmation times. The question then becomes how often do these clusters sync with each other. At one end of the spectrum if your clusters sync at the same rate as bitcoin there will be no appreciable difference in confirmation times except you will have potential centralized points of failure. Syncing less often will decrease block confirmation times but pushes the problem of forking on the blockchain from a single transaction level to a higher level where an entire cluster full of hundreds of thousands of transactions could be on the fork. Then when one cluster doesn't match all the other clusters during a sync those hundreds of thousands of transactions on the fork cluster will be invalidated. Also your statement from the ANN about sync blocks ""Synchronization blocks will be generated by pools located all over the world. In order to maintain high speed of block generation, those polls will maintain a direct connection to each other and coordinate each synchronization block generation. There will be no reward for this kind of blocks."" Not only is this extremely centralized but with no reward no one is going to mine sync blocks which are the most important block in your system. EDIT: Also wanted to add the almost cavalier nature in which you treat the geolocation data that will be collected from all clustercoin users is troubling. In fact there will be very little difference between wireless carriers that use GPS to send your cell phone signal to the nearest base station and Clustercoin's geo-clusters. So the same tools of surveillance will be built within this coin from its inception and surveillance agencies can make easy use of it.",1000118,Jr. Member,dijclarwin,22:53:45,2014-08-16,48,3183,6,☷[ANN]☷BITTREX ICO☷ CLSTR ☷ ClusterCoin ☷ the Future of Money ☷ SOLD OUT!

In the case of a double spend, how does the blockchain know which parallel spend is the correct spend. How does this create efficiency if the block chain has to check with the parallel chains before it can post?  It seems even more inefficient than bitcoin. QUOTE: It is important to note one important detail. While using ClusterCoin the wallet software will still create addresses and send/receive payments as usual. However, your current balance will be calculated within managed forks independently. This means that a single wallet may have different account balance between different forks. This is mandatory to prevent fraud and any possibility of double spending. We understand that users will often require to process transactions between two GEO-clusters and transfer funds from one managed fork to another. /QUOTE This is my favorite part.  How in the hell do you know your balance in each ledger vs the other persons ledger who cares scam.",1000126,Full Member,mlord1010,03:24:37,2014-08-17,126,3183,6,☷[ANN]☷BITTREX ICO☷ CLSTR ☷ ClusterCoin ☷ the Future of Money ☷ SOLD OUT!

The idea we had in mind is to offer the number of coins for the ICO that is well above the expected demand (we've never expected to sell all coins) and let the market decide how much coins will be sold, i.e. let the supply be big enough so that the number of coins outstanding will be driven by the demand only.

Imagine nearly  instant and hardly traceable transactions without taxes. That`s the potential we see in this. 2. Well I hope proof of dev will answer this question 3.

Block reward is only 30 coins This means that after 24 hours of mining there will be roughly 43 200 coins spread across all mining pools out there. It will take around 5 month of mining to mine 7 000 000 coins that you can buy instantly. Also we do not expect to gather 700 BTC - it is just an upper limit. Our aim is 70 BTC at least to support further development. This is roughly equals to 700 000 ICO coins (rest will be destroyed by Bittrex) making ClusterCoins even more rare while mining.

We are hereby pre-announcing the development of CBC - a crypto coin specifically tailored to be used over CB and HAM radio networks. CBC is designed to be useful under any circumstances, as long as there is enough electricity to run a CB or HAM radio station. CBC is particularly useful in situations where the public infrastructure is failing or being controlled by the powers that be. Radio based data transmissions have their own peculiarities which require very careful design to make the network work fluently even under such demanding conditions as only being able to establish half duplex connections with bandwidth as low as 600 - 1200 baud. The CBC project is looking for talented and motivated developers, preferably with CB/HAM radio experience.

The reason for this decision can be seen below. Yes, and since what we are doing differs a lot from most crypto coin projects out there, we need the skills of a very talented team before we can make definitive decisions about protocol details etc. To begin with, we'll need to use UDP instead of TCP, which means designing and implementing stuff such as protocol level ACKs that would normally be handled by the TCP stack.

We are also aware of the HAM Radio Coin and will be contacting the team at some point. Thank you, we'll definitely take your ideas into account and under serious consideration. It seems your thoughts were and are pretty much aligned with what we've been putting together over here. Like TCP, UDP too is part of the TCP/IP protocol family. TCP is not very well suited for slow half duplex connections; there's lots of overhead in it. UDP is much better for the task at hand, allowing us to design details such as ACK so that the protocol works as smoothly as possible even when the connection quality is very poor.",1000295,Newbie,Vertaisvaluutta,19:08:15,2014-08-18,25,3168,1,[PRE-ANN] [CBC] CB Radio Coin - Looking for developers with HAM backgrounds

Both the limitations and the advantages of radio connections are both challenging and inspiring at the same time. Different frequencies have different characteristics that affect the big picture in many ways. It is of course also possible to build full duplex connections, using two radios (or one radio with two oscillators) simultaneously. It would also be possible to do tricks such as combining CB, HAM and GSM frequencies etc. to achieve some possibly rather unexpected solutions. The ideas and the basic design are there.

It's illegal to send encrypted communication over amateur frequencies. It's illegal to use non-voice modes on CB in most places. Keep that in mind when designing your protocol. 2. As someone else already said, just use tcp over packet radio. Don't reinvent the wheel. 3.

9,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=707815.0,80,2628,jiefangqian,"BitAsset Market Manipulation Security « on: Today at 08:34:39 PM » Quote BitAssets are a challenge to bootstrap because it only takes a single bogus trade for someone to print up a billion BitUSD backed by no collateral.   To execute this trade all that is necessary is for someone to gain control of both sides of the order book long enough to execute a trade against themselves at a price they pick.   This attack depends upon two factors: 1) The attacker having financial interest in destroying the network 2) The attacker having a large pot of cash that they can burn to bring it down. 3) The attacker being able to execute his attack in a timely manner. Most of these problems go away once the network is as big as Bitcoin, but when we are young it is much harder to ""secure"" the market peg.  I have just finished implementing everything I think is necessary to launch BitAssets and having the system be secure: 1) There is a minimum market depth required before any shorts or covers are executed (1% XTS) 2) There is a maximum short price that is 50% higher than the current median price feed..  maximum_bid = median_price * 3 / 2 3) Only active delegates may publish a price feed and they must update it every 24 hours. 4) At least 25% of the delegates must be producing a feed What these limits mean is that once trading begins the only time there can be a margin call is when delegates raise the median price feed.  It also means the delegates are circuit breakers in the system.  They can limit the price movements during rapid change giving players time to adjust their positions.  Someone speculating in this market now knows that the value of BTSX in terms of BitUSD cannot fall by more than 33% without the delegates updating the price feed. So what does this give us?    1) A system where the there are up to 101 price feeds for USD / BTSX price, with at least 25 2) By using the median feeds that are way out of line are ignored. 3) Delegates don't set the price and thus the feed does not need to be very accurate and can get by with just one update per day. 4) The price feed is just used as a guardrail that makes attacks ""impossible"" while not actually being used to execute orders 5) Users only need to trust that delegates can produce a feed that is ""close enough"" and don't have to trust any individual delegate.  6) Even if the delegates posted BOGUS feeds all they could do is stop new shorts from being executed.        a) delegates have this power anyway by controlling what transactions get included.        b) if the attacker controls over 50% of the price feeds they must control at least 12% of the delegates and that is already bad.        c) everyone knows who the attacker is based upon their price feeds. In the long-run, we can remove the need for the price feeds once the depth of the market is measured in billions of dollars... or perhaps loosen the price range a bit.   With this in place I believe we can launch a test network for BitUSD tomorrow.   All trading will occur just like it does with user issued assets with the addition that shorts can add bids (selling USD for BTSX) and margin positions can result in asks.",1000351,Sr. Member,jiefangqian,22:55:11,2014-07-27,240,3164,1,Bitshares News--Bytemaster posted in bitsharestalk.org

It will mainly fund giveaways, bounties, draws and random acts of kindness! The rest of the pre-mine will be held by the Devs for their expenses and time, and to fund anything else the rest of the pre-mine might not be able to. We want our coin to have value.  We WILL NOT DUMP coins - it's counter productive! ' But don't you just want to make some quick money?' Wouldn't we all?  But that's not why we’re doing this.  We're trying to look into ways of making cryptos fairer and easier to use.  We want to build a community that will contribute to the future development of Kryptonite and cryptos in general, and we will not disappear.  Our goals also include making it easier to distribute currency to more people in an effort to make a fairer world. Maybe you don't like what we're doing - fine - you don't have to take part in our own little part of this huge experiment! LAUNCH POOLS - Bounties available!

48,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=731814.0,79,7195,Earthgiver,"What is it about crypto-currency that makes it so intriguing? That millions of people will buy, trade and spend something that has no physical value. If we tried this outside of the internet realm it probably would not work so well. What if I took a piece of paper and drew a design on it and told you I would buy your watch with it because it is worth, according to my design, the limited supply and a few other calculations, roughly $300. But your watch is only worth $100. Are you going to give me your watch plus $200 of your hard earned money? No! I don't think so!  For this reason, Fiat currency will only hold out until the first doubts start to rise. [Bitcoin and Alt-coin’s] exist because we support them, we vote for them, we elect them and it is by popularity and our Hope in them that they increase. What happens if one day that support stops, hope stops? What happens when people fully understand that they have invested billions of dollars in something that has no physical value? Will anyone refund your money, your time and dedication that you have put into supporting and strengthening this imaginary investment? If paper money used by countries fail because they have become semi-fiat in only being partially backed by a commodity like Papiermark(Germany), Peso(Argentina), Dollar(Zimbabwe), Sol(Peru), Escudo(Chile) and currency like the U.S dollar that is falling in value and recognition around the world, then what makes us think that a full fiat currency will last forever? I for one don’t think it will. Its new, its exciting, it is fun to be a part of the change, to be on the forefront of the technological super currency. This will fade with time as it loses its novelty. Everything fades with time. It has already started in the alt-coin world. The stale, seemingly motionless rise and fall of the all mighty Bitcoin, when everything is going in Bitcoin's favor and the other Major alt-coins are seemingly only drifting in cyber-space, not making major gains. The junk coin creators can see it. That’s why there are so many new coins coming into the market. A young lion won’t attack the strong and healthy pack leader. It is when that leader becomes old and tired, that all the young lions attack. Is that not what we are seeing? If I am correct BTC was worth over $1,000 per coin at one time, right? Why then are we sitting at just over $500? Is that a shining example of sustainability? So, if I dislike it so much why in the world would I attempt to join in the madness? Well to be quite honest I like money, as do most of you, I suspect. I also see an ability to take something that could be better and make it great. Because the idea of crypto-currency works, what is missing is something to give it value. Something, so that we know that even if all else fails, we still have something solid in the end. So, with that thought in mind... I bring you Silvercoin (SIL)  The Silver backed crypto-currency. Each coin has value because every coin is backed by real 1/10 .999 Fine Silver. Every coin has a true stated value. As a crypto-currency it is fluid, you can hold it in a e-wallet, e-vault or paper wallet  and just make money as silver increases or you can spend it in an online store or on a game, you can even sell it back for a known value. The other thing about Silvercoin that you are not going to get from all the other alt-coins is a guarantee of return. There is a 10% feed-in from anything sold in the Silvercoin store or made from Silvercoin games. That 10% is evenly dispersed over the previously purchased Silvercoins. You also get 10% from Battle Tokens. The more coins that are bought, the higher we drive the silver market. The higher we drive the silver market the more money you make. When silver prices increase you make money. If the Silvercoin store makes money, you make money. If our betting games make money, you make money, when battle tokens make money, you make money.  The dollar amount grows and the amount of silver you have grows, So stop playing with your imagination.  Isn’t it time you got physical? Follow us on Twitter for Launch Time and Date SilverCoin SIL x-11 POW No Block Halving Coins Per Block - .02+ Target Spacing- 3min Target Time Span- DGW3 Transaction Confirmations- 6 Maturity- 21 blocks Max SilverCoin- 120,000,000 P2P Port-11060 RPC Port-21060 You have to remember when you look at this, that this isn't comparable to any launch you have read before. This real silver can't be given out at ten thousand ounces every day to be mined. There has to be accountability, that the value of this coin cannot be compromised. So here is how the pre-mine and distribution works . 120,000,000 coins 113,150,000 pre-mined for step distribution 3,696,720 step mining avail 3,000,000 games and giveaways 153,280 for shipping, depository and fees etc Coin only distributed for 5 years and mined for 110 years. year 1 - 10,000 coins per day will be launched, mined award per block is .02 year 2 - 20,000 coins per day will be launched, mined award per block is .04 year 3 - 40,000 coins per day will be launched, mined award per block is .06 year 4 - 80,000 coins per day will be launched, mined award per block is .08 year 5 - 160,000 coins per day will be launched, mined award per block is .10 year 6 - mined award per block is .12 year 7 - mined award per block is .14 year 8 - mined award per block is .16 year 9 - mined award per block is .18 year 10 - mined award per block is .20 year 10-100 - mined award per block is .20 I know I am supposed keep this short, so please see our FAQs/Q&A for more info! On the website, instead of faucets, we have a variety of games you can play. You enter your name and you add your wallet address into the email section. Just your wallet address! You can play each game once per day. This is also where we host the SilverCoin store.  All prices are listed in (s) SilverCoin. You pick your items, go to your shopping cart and check out. An invoice is sent to you with the payment address for the wallet.  As soon as you pay the amount due the order is processed and shipped. Jewelry is shipped from China and takes a couple of weeks and there are no returns to China, so make sure you check sizes on Rings etc before you buy. This is also where you go to buy Silvercoin. When buying SilverCoin, I ask that you have some understanding with regard to transaction times. It is very foreseeable that we will have many orders to process at the same time. We will process orders as fast as we are able to do so. Make sure that when you buy SilverCoin you put your wallet address in the field above the ""Buy Now"" button. When you decide to sell SilverCoin back to us - no more jumping through hoops to try to get real money instead of gift card's - we will buy back SilverCoin from you.  This does however take a couple days as we do have real silver we have to move to get you paid. Mints are much faster to take your money than to give you your money. This will at least happen in the beginning, since we will likely have some refinement of our processes as we mature. Once a larger reserve is built it should then become a much more streamlined, expedited process.   Feel free to try out the games that are on the website. It should go without saying that anything you win before launch is void and will not be paid out. Some of the prices in the store still have to be adjusted, and more items will be added prior to launch. To those that are thinking about copying this idea with Silver, Gold, Copper etc. Let me issue a word of caution to you. If you do not know what you are doing when it comes to Buying, Selling and Trading Commodities or Currency in the real world. STOP. This is not a game! you are no longer playing with imaginary coins. This is real, and real consequences come if you make mistakes. You have been warned and I have no pity for you if you try and cannot overcome the known and unknown obstacles that lay before you.

Syscoin directly recycles transaction fees by regenerating them and redistributing them to network miners. The regeneration of service fees is the key incentive for miners to continue to mine Syscoin once all base coins are mined, and thus enable and guarantee its services into the future.   Reward Schedule: Mining Reward Schedule (Updated 7/23) Development Team and Status:     Syscoin's team is not new to the industry, they bring the experience of an award-winning team to drive this incredibly innovative project. The team wanted to be able to release ground-breaking technology without limiting itself to any one specific innovation. Hence, the name Syscoin was coined- it allows for the building of multiple value-added and innovative services without being constrained to a single innovation.   Syscoin on Social Media Reddit: http://reddit.com/r/syscoin Twitter: https://twitter.com/syscoin Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Syscoin Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/Syscoin Google +: https://plus.google.com/+SyscoinOrg Syscoin in the News:   Syscoin Presale will be Secured Through Moolah.io's Escrow Platform (Cryptoarticles Business, July 14th, 2014) Syscoin - Building in the Blockchain (Coins Source, July 8th, 2014) Business on the Blockchain- Syscoin Pre-sale Starts Soon!

Syscoin is a crypto-currency and a financial infrastructure all in one!   Syscoin implements a distributed marketplace integrated directly into the blockchain and more! This provides huge benefits to businesses or individuals looking to secure their data or marketplace in a decentralized manner that can never be ""taken down"" by having a single point of failure- the network makes this impossible. Now businesses can use Syscoin's incorruptible network to ensure the security of their sensitive data even if their redundancy systems fail - in the blockchain we trust!   Syscoin ensures the health of it's network with the ability to be merge-mined with any other SCRYPT coin. Syscoin provides a variety of useful decentralized, cryptographically-secured services based on Bitcoin's Blockchain technology:   Business on the Blockchain. Buy and sell anything with Syscoin's distributed marketplace integrated into the blockchain. This isn't a cryptocurrency PLUS a marketplace. It's a marketplace built into a cryptocurrency. The Syscoin network enables the creation of marketplaces of any kind, ranging from small community trading platforms to large corporate marketplaces like eBay to fully encrypted hidden marketplaces. This does not limit itself to marketplaces that accept only Syscoin. Syscoin's blockchain innovations are merely an infrastructure upon which marketplaces can be built.   Brokerage on the Blockchain. Exchange discrete data directly on the Blockchain. Documents like deeds, wills, trusts, stocks, bonds and contracts can now be created, mutually agreed upon, and transferred without the necessity of a third-party to authenticate the transaction; the Syscoin network itself acts as the third party, guaranteeing cryptographically-verifiable authenticity. Syscoin provides a foundation for the creation of provably fair arbitration systems which cannot be corrupted.   Certificates on the Blockchain ( demo video ). Using the cryptography of the Blockchain; Issue, authorize, and exchange digital certificates. With Syscoin, anyone can register as a certificate issuer and issue provably-unique certificates which can be authenticated by anyone using Syscoin's cryptographic proof of work. This allows for the creation and free exchange of a any kind of digital asset such as stocks, bonds, ownership certificates, warranties, receipts, tickets, certifications, diplomas, software licenses.   Miners Matter! By being universally merge-mineable with all Scrypt coins, Syscoin is prepared for the coming Scrypt ASIC boom. By simultaneously distributing coins to anyone mining any other Scrypt coin, it ensures that both democratic coin distribution and strong network health are achieved shortly after Syscoin's genesis. The Syscoin presale has ended:   PRESALE PUBLIC LEDGER    Syscoin Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):   Q: What's the difference between Sys and Ether? A: Syscoin is based on well known, peer reviewed codebases (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Namecoin) that have been combined and extended. Ethereum is an attempted rewrite of this in a sense to try and deliver a turing-complete smart contract solution. This is not the same as Syscoin. Additionally: Sooner delivery of it's presale; Syscoin was delivered on August 16, 2014. The amount of ether that will be mined every year is dependent on how many they sell during their presale. The more they sell the more that will be mined the year of release, giving a bigger dilution to the already mined/bought coins. After Ether presale closes you have to wait till at least December/January to see anything; if at all. Syscoin offered a 100% refund on failure to deliver of it's promised 5 core-features (escrow thru Moolah). The Ethereum team is allowed to use up to 5000btc before anything is even done properly or working and if it is a complete failure not a single refund was offered and no escrow option . Q: What's the difference between Sys and Cloakcoin? A: Please see this detailed comparison .   Q: How can I buy/sell Syscoin? A: Syscoin can be traded directly on >> Moolah's trading platform. << (coming soon: Mintpal!) although any other exchange is welcome to trade Syscoin as well as long as they provide us with immediate contact details so we can update them with any technical details necessary. Q: How will I get my physical reward after purchasing presale coins? A: The Syscoin Team will have a portal up in the next few days where you can enter your presale purchase info and and ship-to address. Once verified you're reward will be shipped ASAP. We ship internationally.   Q: What do you mean when you say Moolah will be the exclusive exchange? Will Syscoin not be on other exchanges? A: We have a partnership with Moolah and we are coordinating with them to get Syscoin on all of their platforms [including their exchange] at launch as part of this partnership. This doesn't mean other exchanges can't add us. We're just working directly with Moolah in a much larger sense to try to make Syscoin's capabilities more accessible to the masses so their's will be the first exchange we are listed on.   Q: I didn't send enough BTC for my presale purchase because I forgot the network fee! What do I do? A: Simply ""top up"" the address you sent the initial payment to, within 6hrs you'll get a confirmation that you're top-up was successfully registered and presale purchase is complete.    Q: How long have you been working on this project? And could you briefly describe your planned time commitment to this going forward? A: 8+ months, time commitment moving forward is as much time as we have outside of our normal day-job/lives and we are also on-boarding additional developers to supplement that capacity if/when needed.   Q: How does the coin production/distribution setup provide insulation from the risk of massive miner/whale dumps? Is there an estimate out there of the max # of daily BTC trading volume that might be needed to absorb mined coins? A: If you check out the schedule here I think the values at the far right speak for themselves. Also keep in mind there is a 25btc limit per buyer in an attempt to insulate from an over-concentration of wealth leading to ""massive dumps""      Q: What immediate plans do you have beyond delivery of these core guaranteed features to further increase the value of the coin/network? A: Collected funds are being focused on several things, primarily building partnerships with large players in the crypto space (I mean companies, not whales). We're also going to be spending some of the collection on bounties, although not all of it as we do have a small amount of Syscoin for bounties as well. Then of course, future development; we're already trying to push additional features (2) into the coin prior to launch, on top of the 4 that are already completed. Outside of that we will hold much of the BTC for ongoing costs that we can't currently predict. We already have some deals in place that look to exercise the BTC we're collecting and the deals we're working on aren't cheap, but will ultimately take Syscoin to the next level. That being said nothing can be ""guaranteed to increase value"" in crypto as its a highly experimental field and as such we make no such claims.   Q: Along those lines, are smart-contracts/prediction markets/futures/options things you plan to implement, or can see being (fairly quickly) implementable into this framework? A: Some aspects of what you're calling out could be implemented in Syscoin fairly quickly but we have other roadmap plans that supersede them in priority at the moment. Additionally we need to discuss our roadmap after escrow and reputation systems. Once we get past that feature set it seems like there isn't a strong call for one thing or another just yet so we we're going to focus on smart-contracts within Syscoin but things like prediction markets, futures and options are on the roadmap at the moment; doesn't mean they can't be added. Keep in mind the target demographic here is large financial markets, services and systems so we will be prioritizing features in that vein of development.   Q: What do you consider the three biggest uncertainties regarding development implementation (either with core or future-beyond-core features)? A: How can we implement a fully automated escrow (we're working on an agent-based escrow currently)? How can we implement smart contracts as is commonly understood in crypto on top of the Syscoin Certificates foundational structure? Which features will be the most heavily leveraged and how will that possibly change the roadmap? ie: what if data storage is a the huge feature everyone uses instead of market or certificates?

A: Syscoin Overview Whitepaper (Draft)   Q:Isn't this the same thing as NXT? A: No, NXT is an attempt at a Bitcoin rewrite from scratch and is NOT hosted on github for community contribution. Syscoin is on github and is a fork of the Bitcoin codebase.   Q:Isn't this the same thing as BitHalo? A: Feature-wise there are parallels (smart contracts) but Syscoin takes its feature set further from what we know of BitHalo. Reading what's available about BitHalo it is a an abstraction on top of a blockchain, rather than being directly integrated. We need to do more research on this as its very new and the source code isn't available yet (that I know of) so we're operating largely off press-release/marketing information when it comes to technical comparisons to BitHalo.   Q: When is the presale? A: The presale ended on August 16th, 2014. You can now purchase Syscoin directly at Mintpal for SYS/Fiat on Moolah's Trade.moolah.io   Q: When is the launch date? A: The soft launch began on August 16th at 12:00pm PST   Q: How will the presale proceeds be spent? A: It will be used to further adoption of Syscoin within the altcoin space, to build relations with other partners in the crypto/altcoin space, marketing and to cover past and future development and hosting costs for Syscoin related sites and services.   Q: Can I see a video of the coin in action? A: Yes. Here it is! [INSERT VIDEO LINK]   Q: How many people are on the team? Who are you? A: We have six people on the Syscoin team. We're an experienced team that has received rewards in the past for our work on other coins within the crypto community. We've taken that experience and decided to channel it into something real and innovative rather than another clone coin.   Q: Where's the infographics? A: We have a graphic outlining the features in a psuedo-technical form here , we're working on a more robust infographic which we'll release soon.   Q: Isn't SCRYPT dead? Why another SCRYPT coin? A: Scrypt is alive and well! The large driver for non-scrypt algorithms (x11, x13, x15, x [n] ) is to try and combat ASICs since these hit the market just a few months ago. Because Syscoin uses block-by-block retargeting and can be merge-mined the proliferation of Scrypt ASICs are a good thing for Syscoin. This means that Scrypt mining is here to stay and the network will be healthy for a very long time.   Q: Can I send any file on the blockchain using Syscoin? A: Yep. Each entry is currently limited to 0.5mb so you'd need to spread out larger files across several entries (like a multipart zip file) and of course fees will apply the more data you store, the more it will cost (unlike Namecoin these fees go to miners instead of being burned).   Q: Could a 51% attack result in a certificate / asset double-spend? A: Technically, yes. We are looking at Slingshield to try and mitigate the possibility of this type of attack although it will not be implemented at launch, and we may improve upon it if we see the potential for enhancement. Merged-mining with any other Scrypt coin, however, ensures that the hash-rate will be widely spread-out between many pools so we doubt that this will be a problem, in the long-run at least.   Q: How far is development? A: Development on the core feature set is complete. We are constantly looking for new ways to innovate and have many ideas for future development.   Q: Wont this turn into a silk road? A: We are only offering the technology to facilitate distributed marketplaces. We aren't responsible for how it is leveraged.   Q: Why doesn't it show the coin dev on the website? A: Our core crypto developer is very active but also holds a high level position within a private company outside of the crypto space that doesn't understand the crypto space. Because there is a concern of misconceptions by the employer regarding work-focus being in such a executive position, public references to our coin developer's personal information have been omitted until this is no longer a concern.   --- FAQ Last updated: 7/19/2014   8/5/2014: Important Announcement about initial Syscoin Service Fees In order to be as transparent as possible and to make clear this decision is a strategic one; we want to clarify some information about the “service fees” tied to Syscoin services. There is nothing like Syscoin currently on the market. Its closest competitors dramatically under-price their service offerings (speaking specifically about Namecoin). Due to the fact there are no analogous services in the “real world” by which to attempt to price Syscoin services. As such we will be following an initial pricing strategy that attempts some level of “price discovery”.   What this means is that we don’t know how much posting an offer, reserving an alias, or storing data should cost. We do know that fees need to be high enough to add value / discourage abuse while not being prohibitively expensive. Because of this the initial service fee schedule for Syscoin services will be temporary. The prices for services will be on the high side to start and then decay on a fixed schedule until a predetermined block height at which we’ll release a new wallet that implements a more effective fee schedule based on the market activity we observe during the initial price discovery schedule period.   Properly pricing these services is difficult as the price of Syscoin will certainly fluctuate and we don’t want to undervalue or overvalue these services. We’re pricing services based on the pre-sale regular phase price (0.00000518) which is arguably low meaning this may overprice services if it's value increases, something we’ll just have to observe and another reason for the decay schedule. We’re planning on pricing the Syscoin services fees very competitively relative to the cost of the closest comparable service in the real world such as domain name for aliases, ecommerce/ebay for the marketplace features, dropbox/googledrive/others for data storage etc.- keeping in mind that Syscoin services are distributed and cryptographically provable which the services being compared to do not provide. Moolah Partnership The Syscoin Team is pleased to announce that we've officially partnered with Moolah (Moopay LTD) ( http://moolah.io ). Moolah has secured the Syscoin presale via their escrow platform. We have a dedicated partnership in place so there will be a custom portal specifically for Syscoin presale investors to reserve their coins. Moolah has assist in distributing the Syscoin to investors via wallet.dat or pub/priv keys that can be imported directly into your Syscoin wallet.   This partnership goes beyond just the presale and launch of Syscoin. Moolah offers a host of crypto related services to the global marketplace, they are not just limited to US customers. They have a trading platform, a merchant platform, and an escrow platform already in place and are in the process of building numerous other services for the crypto space. They have never once been hacked. This is a strategic partnership not only to provide a secure escrow platform for presale investors but also to allow for long term growth of Syscoin via an immediate ecosystem of services enabled by Moolah. Moolah is currently in the process of transitioning all of their core services to their V2 platform for assured reliability- Syscoin will be available through these services. Moolah's V2 trading platform as well as their recently acquired Mintpal, will also be the first exchanges to offer Syscoin .   There are natural intersections between the services Syscoin offers and the platform capabilities Moolah can directly implement on top those distributed services. We look forward to exploring these possibilities with the Moolah team. Together we could bring the first decentralized large-scale marketplaces, digital certificates, datastore, and other such services to the mainstream market. We're excited to announce this partnership and move forward with such a well known pillar of the crypto community![/list][/list][/list]",1000524,Hero Member,danosphere,20:31:25,2014-04-27,490,3152,1,[ANN] Syscoin - Business on the Blockchain - LAUNCHED!

Of course as needed I do development on whatever is needed, whenever needed- I have a variety of coding skills in my toolbelt so I help out on several ""code"" fronts (I did the graphics for this post!). Coderboo is *the* dev and really deserves the credit for these innovations. He has been working on this alone for 6+ months... in loose coordination with me for the past 3-4 months. Only in about the last month or so our release timelines tightened up dramatically due to the possibility of competition entering the market. For that reason I had to make some hard choices in terms of other projects I am involved with and how to spend my time. I feel there is significant innovation already present in Syscoin and the roadmap gets me even more excited- I want to be part of something disruptive and innovative! We all know the demand for a technology that facilitates decentralized markets is in high demand- look at DarkMarket. Syscoin is very similar except its sole purpose is not only to facilitate anonymous marketplace transactions... although it is certainly a capability launching in its initial feature set.

7784,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=587080.0,79,287165,danosphere,"Glad to help! I'd really like to release an open-source marketplace web frontend built atop the Syscoin marketplace feature but that may come by means of a bounty. We already have several new screens in the wallet to browse all marketplace offers, as well as interact with the other core features of Syscoin. A web-based marketplace frontend that only displays a subset of the current offerings in the Syscoin marketplace (specific to a given market- ie: sysEbay) for instance would be a very clear way of communicating Syscoin's value proposition in a hands-on manner. The marketplace data can be stored as encrypted on unencrypted- that is up to the person implementing the frontend. Will be exciting to see what people build on top of the Syscoin framework! And this is just the beginning! We chose the name ""Syscoin"" so we could generically innovate within this coin, rather than calling it ""Marketplacecoin"" or something like that and being stuck to a single feature. The initial release will have the features called out in the OP, and we'll be putting in more features as we see what the community needs.

I restored the coin for the community because of the previous devs scam. 2. I spent several weeks trying to get the exchanges to re-activate the XHC market for the community! (Not an easy task.) 3. Once the exchanges got re-activated the majority of people sold all prior holdings. Buy volume was non existent. 4. The community requested a 2 year mining period against my wishes. This allowed for miners to continuously dump on the exchanges. 5. I requested community help and responsibilities for members. No one stepped up. Some said they would help but never actually did anything besides talk and no continued development donations. 6. I requested the hate mail & negative spam to stop but it only increased causing continuous damage. 7. I held no XHC 2.0 coins so I could have never dumped. I got scammed on the XHC 1.0 coins and sold remaining for a .235 BTC gain that I used for XHC 2.0 Development. 8. I offered a community skype conference and no one showed up except for a developer that was referred to me by a community member. When I asked for his assistance.. He would only work on XHC for Bitcoins and was to busy to donate his time for the community. I volunteered my time and I did my part... I got the coin rebuilt and got it re-listed on the major exchanges & pools. Since there was no volume on the exchanges, any upgrades to the wallet are irrelevant because exchanges were just going to delist it as they don't spend time upgrading wallets when there is no volume, They delist them. The Market decided this! not me as those are external factors outside of my control. I believe the main reason was due to the negative spam comments and prior history with XHC. The treatment and misplaced blame I received on this coin was disgusting and I recommend that any future developers proceed with extreme caution when restoring a coin, as you run the risk of being associated with a prior negative condensation as well as the previous developers gang of trolls. I did this to build reputation not loose it I will be on Skype tomorrow at 10AM PST as a last attempt to find someone who will take over the XHC development, the attacks pointed to me while misplaced, just end up hurting XHC. If no one shows up from the community to take over then this will be my last attempt to help despite the trolls.

Basically, I'm asking if you have any details of how you're going to bring TGC up to Slimcoin's current status? The github commit records show that you created the a/c, liyang19901122 forked slimcoin at commit a8be716fa426d7c021bca932ea3dd6ca103c481e, rebranded it and dropped it into the repos for you to pick up the ball and run from there. Unfortunately, you were a bit early with the fork and now TGC is missing the subsequent changes to slimcoin that enable it to work as designed. Are you intending to bring the TGC code up to date or simply abandon it? If the former, do you have the requisite technical support? Or are we all done here? I wouldn't blame you if we are, slimcoin has been presenting the dev with a significant technical challenge and BitCoin 0.7.3 is an odd choice of foundation for a 2014 altcoin.

Keep up the good work! It's great to see that even in the midst of all this FUD and backlash. Glad to see you guys are really building and innovating for the long haul. I saw that there are some people wanting to make a more short term play with this coin. There is nothing wrong with that. Here are a few tips I have for you guys: Keep an eye on the remaining early bird allotment, and note how fast it is decreasing every day. Track it every 3-6 hours. For instance, in the past couple of hours, it has been pretty slow. If it stays that way and mid-August arrives and even early bird hasn't sold out, I would stay away from this coin as a PnD target because I don't think you guys will get the quick spike you want once this starts trading in the markets. HOWEVER, if early bird goes fast in the next few days, then start checking every couple of hours or more, because that's what every other person will be doing. Because the IPO is capped, you ideally want to buy right before the cap gets hit, or not at all. Never too early, preferably not in the middle, really just late as possible. I would set a target of as soon as cap hits 80% or 90% or something like that.

We will be releasing additional information about Syscoin features (demo videos and whitepapers) over the next 4 weeks that is why there is such a long gap before launch. We're also using that time to finalize testing of Syscoin and if we finish early, possibly add or enhance the planned features (TBD). We are also planning to do some kinda of live Q&A for presale buyers/public. We need to figure out the best format for this; needs to be moderated in some form. Maybe we can get a journalist or someone to act as moderator, this is something we're definitely looking into doing and working on the logistics. We'll have more news as the presale goes on. Want to thank everyone again for their interest. Special thanks to those who have helped answer some questions for other users and also a huge thank you to all of those of have purchased presale coins already.

It seems people like what VIA did (of course you had the people that hated that their total amount of coins went down over time too) and having a well known person put their rep on the line helped. Just because of the way Syscoin is doing the presale many people won't buy in. Then I'm hearing overpriced and miners dump. 100 sat, 300 sat seems to be a more common answer. They are just doing all sorts of math and probably just looking for the number that works out best for the investor (them). It is a scrypt coin so the people that will be mining the most are most likely already rich. Will they want to mine and dump? Probably not. Then you got the people who are unsure what will be actually launched and how they will work and who will use them. For now it is just words in the OP. Will it be easy to use? Will there be instructions? If it is too hard people will give up and claim the coin is no good. Finally people think in a month everyone will forget about it and move on. Invest now, tie up your bitcoins for a month and then launch time comes and everyone found a new coin and won't come back to this one.

I'm sure in the short term it is about getting the word out via websites, blogs, person to person, building web sites and telling people to check it out.

7784,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=587080.960,79,287165,danosphere,"Good question. Syscoin actually acts as a replacement for those notary publics and other centralized systems around legal agreements in that regard. The network acts as the unbiased third party. Remember Syscoin's feature is digital certificates which can act as a form of a contract. We are working on expanding the use cases of this feature into what are commonly known as ""Smart Contracts"" which require signatures (as in pub/priv keys) from more than one party. This smart contract feature is something we're still working on and will be an additional feature/enhancement on top of the certificates functionality which acts as a foundation for this- trying to get this in at launch but it will most likely be post-launch, and initially we'll just have the certificates portion. Regarding laws related to digital contracts/certs/wills/deeds I don't think there are any that speak to this kind of application (or I don't know of them). I think its a new field in that sense and if this catches on (which it will, since almost all bitcoin 2.0 implementations are focusing on ""smart contracts"") then we'll see more laws that speak specifically to this type of thing. I answered this question earlier but it was a few pages back, I'll dig it up and add it to the FAQ. In short- using presale funds to reduce friction moving your assets to Syscoin, making the value proposition to ""Joe User"" clear and salient, marketing to the crypto world and partners in that space (of which we already have a few) and marketing to the non-crypto world to increase real world adoption. Real world adoption is going to start slow, just like with Bitcoin this is a paradigm shift. Real world adoption is the main focus though. We know Syscoin can enable ""shadier things"" so to speak but we want to enabled larger, legitimate decentralized financial systems. It will take time, we expect bumps in the road. It impossible to predict how this will all play out once we launch as there is nothing that is 1:1 comparable to Syscoin on the market at this time. Remember when Bitcoin first came out? Who would have thought Overstock.com, Newegg.com, Dell, and others would start accepting it as actual currency? Yet here we are years later in basically a completely different world because of Bitcoin; but no one could have predicted that with any accuracy, it'd just be speculation.",1000751,Hero Member,danosphere,19:03:26,2014-07-20,490,3152,49,[ANN] Syscoin - Business on the Blockchain - LAUNCHED!

I think we'd probably wait for some smaller indie shops to be stood up using Syscoin, work with them to see how hard it was and how we can ease that pain. Then we as a team (not an anonyous username) would take those lessons learned to some crypto-friendly mainstream companies and see if we can get signed up for some pilots with those larger players.

Yes this thread has exploded lately, but it's not nearly as busy as, say, NEM.. NEM Stakes are also at a current market cap under 1M (when you account for the fact that only ~600 are on the market). Not saying the level of innovation isn't there, but the question is whether you can expect to see sufficient earlybird adoption to sell out the presale. My guess is that you'll see something closer to 25%-50% of the presale purchased. The end result is that a smaller amount would be premined and the marketcap would thus be much lower, leaving more room for growth.  The size of the presale is also somewhat concerning. How long before the amount of syscoin doubles? Well, a premine of 18% is 360 Million coins. Based on block timing and halving schedule, it would take 2 years before an amount equal to the premine is mined.  TBH, not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it does seem like quite a long time.

Marketcap is the total value of any product/currency at the time it is available, at launch.

That will be the marketcap at launch, plain and simple, and will only go up very slightly every day. That would bring us currently to 34th position, right under Potcoin..

To those who have had issues with Moolah you MUST send the exact amount to the address delivered to you via email, REMEMBER TO INCLUDE FEES!! Otherwise it will not be credited. IF YOU FORGOT TO SEND THE FEES, please send an additional payment (""top up"") to the generated address to cover the difference, and then PM me your email address you used to invest. We'll match up the mismatches later today, you'r btc and your investment are safe. We will be adding some clarification about this to the moolah page and to the OP. Regarding people talking about this ""top 10 6mil market cap at launch"". Yes, it appears that some people don't know how to calculate marketcap.. Marketcap is the total value of any product/currency at the time it is available, at launch. IE at launch Syscoin will have 18% out; that's 360000000 total Syscoin, if we take the regular phase price of 518 satoshi that would bring it to 1864.8 BTC at launch. Currently worth $1144987.20. That will be the marketcap at launch, plain and simple, and will only go up very slightly every day. That would bring us currently to 34th position, right under Potcoin.. I mean, if you think that this type of innovation that has never been done before is less valueable than a clonecoin, then do not invest; but you probably should not invest in anything at that point. See also http://coinmarketcap.com/ -> cap is based on ""Available Supply"" not ""Total Future Supply"" which isn't even a column. +1. Thank you. I won't repeat what you said because you said it perfectly. Quoted for those that missed it or didn't read. +1 We've been reviewing some of these concerns and even consulting with some other teams about it. I'm not sure how you get 8btc buy volume a day = 100btc volume a day. Also that 8btc support is only for the first 15days. At the same time we're not discounting your statements; we'll look at this again and see if there is something that warrants change here. Remember we haven't launched yet. Thank you! Well you get a bounty anyway for writing us up and I appreciate the support regardless. Feel free to contact me directly, preferably via email ( dan@syscoin.org ) so I can expedite remediation. Just like you said- top up the address to the correct amount, email/pm me and I'll make sure its properly credited ASAP. If you sent too much contact me as well, I'll refund the overspend and then your purchase will be confirmed. I'm doing my best to help everyone here. To be extremely clear- Presale purchases are not refundable and are not immediately tradeable/sellable via any forum that the Syscoin Team is responsible for. Any future posts talking about selling presale assets prior to COIN LAUNCH will be deleted. If you want to create you own thread to manage that and the liability around that be my guest and feel free to link to it from here. Sorry if you misunderstood, its always better to seek clarification than to act on certain assumptions. I see some people concerned about the 4 weeks- i mentioned this earlier but I'll say it again. If we sell out sooner, we may (may != WE WILL) launch sooner as well. We're testing things right now, and its looking very good and we haven't hit anything that would prevent us from launching sooner we just want a more immediate ecosystem available at launch and it takes some time to get that sorted. That being said, if we feel we're in a good place to launch sooner in a ""Sell out"" scenario, we may do that! If I missed anything pls call it out, I still have to answer the question on datastore which is a bit more technical and I'll get that reply to you later today. A bunch of pages popped up overnight and I can only quote so many pages back so if I missed you please let me know.",1000865,Hero Member,danosphere,16:02:41,2014-07-20,490,3152,44,[ANN] Syscoin - Business on the Blockchain - LAUNCHED!

7784,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=587080.820,79,287165,danosphere,"A few things and thoughts I'd like to add to this thread. Before I begin I should mention that I'm not associated with the SysCoin team or Moolah in any way. My opinions are my own.   Moolah's exchange is very new. I think it's literally 2-3 days old, so the jury is out on whether it will be a successful exchange with high trading volumes in the future. Maybe it won't, but I expect SysCoin will be traded on other platforms soon enough, which is why this specific issue shouldn't concern people too much. I personally haven't used Moolah for anything so far, although I have been aware of their site and services for quite some time. I've been following their progress, and generally speaking, I think that they're moving in the right direction and have a good grasp on what the altcoin scene requires and desires. I like their user interface and overall approach. Moolah is (obviously) more than just an exchange, so it's quite possible that a different part of their business will take-off and they will find their success in some ""non-exchange"" niche. And maybe they won't become successful, who knows...  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - With that out of the way, I think some people in this thread need to take a step back for a second. I'm not trying to call-out (or offend) anyone in particular, but be realistic with your expectations. There are of course many legitimate and interesting questions being asked. However, everyone needs to remember that we're talking about a start-up company. It takes time to build a brand, gain recognition, become a trusted service provider, etc. How long has it taken Bitcoin to be accepted by mainstream merchants? Bitcoin opened a door that will make it much easier for those that follow, but even Bitcoin has a lot of work to do before it becomes widely used/accepted. On that note, when it comes to investing in start-up companies, at least as far as I'm concerned, there are two main things to take into consideration. 1. Do you believe in the product? I think the answer to this question is pretty straightforward. We're all participating in this thread and forum because we clearly see the potential that cryptocurrencies and block-chain applications have. Whether or not SysCoin will be successful at marketing and selling their product is an entirely different question. That's why investing in start-up companies is a risky business. 2. Do you believe in the people involved? This is perhaps the most important question. These type of ventures require a number of people with a range of different skills. From where I'm sitting, it definitely seems like the SysCoin team is well-rounded, professional, and meticulous. Now, if these two boxes are ticked then it's really just a matter of calculating whether or not you (as an investor) are getting an equitable deal, and whether you believe there's a good enough chance you will get a decent return on your investment.

((64800-21600)x768)+(21600x1024)+(2000000000x0.18) Using the normal rate not the early bird price this implies a market valuation after (60 days) of 2151.23328 BTC at current rates $1,346,930.  At launch, before mining starts the market cap will be closer to $1,150,000.   Miners will not have much control of the market in comparison to initial investors. No idea where you got 30,000 btc from, when all coins have been generated (not for a long time), 2,000,000,000 coins at a price of 0.00000518 is still only a 10,360 BTC market cap.   Personally I think there isn't going to be a large instant profit by investing in the IPO, but I think maybe a conservative 50% short term increase if the launch goes well. If not much of the presale sells, I predict a good short term profit.  Long term will depend on the devs (Disclaimer I invested 5BTC)",1000957,Full Member,Len,10:39:35,2014-07-20,166,3152,39,[ANN] Syscoin - Business on the Blockchain - LAUNCHED!

It's not something I can predict with any level of accuracy. Roughly though? If I can provide a ballpark and not have people question and then requestion why its that % (since these are ROUGH): 40% Future development (current team + supplemental developers) - this is long term. People say being involved with a coin for 2-5 years is crazy... why is that crazy? Just because other devs have burned this community doesn't mean we will. 15-20% Marketing to crypto community and lookin for partners that will aid long term growth. 20-40% Marketing to main stream, looking for mainstream partners outside of the cryptoverse Last 2 numbers are variable because that is a hard call, we may find a strong crypto partner that help raise awareness in the wallstreet-like demographic and so that's why the last 2 numbers are sliding. Again, these are rough numbers. We have decent working features right now. We will be using the presale funds to push it hard as well as make clear the value-prop for companies, and users (remember there are 3 other features... you are focusing on one). Some do, we don't. Hopefully my answers show you we are really srsly thinking about how to make this work long term. I definitely didn't need to respond (see also: almost any other coin that has had an IPO, don't tell you much if anything about where those funds go [developer pockets]). I'm being honest, some will go to developer pockets for the time that's already been spent on Syscoin, but majority will be positioned for forward moving development/dev hiring, partnerships, and marketing. If anyone does a pump and dump the Syscoin Team is in no way involved. The coins from our 2% will be on cold wallets which we'll publicly list. We are here to stick around. You're right this isn't going to be an overnight miracle, we aren't expecting that. What we are expecting is slow adoption and growth through proper marketing and making the value proposition to business owners a clear and salient argument. Also, making sure the barriers to entry / transferring you inventory into Syscoin are very small. I think i spoke to this a few pages back- we'll be trying to launch a system that is that is ""software for ordering system, marketplace, sometimes customization"", open source it and make it easy for people to stand up. We also have partners that are working in parallel tracks to help us enable this on an even larger scale (already). Most biggers stores accept Bitcoin NOW.... how long ago did it launch though? Same principle applies here. Its going to be a progressive effort. I also want to call out what others have mentioned- marketplaces are but one of four core features we have ready for launch. There seems to be some confusion around how you'll get your Syscoin once the launch fires off, let me clarify: Prior to launch investors will receive an email at the address you entered on the Moolah site; The Syscoin team will also make it clear when these emails have been sent out (via twitter, newsletter, and BCT) in case they go to your spam folder. The email will contain a link to a secure page on Moolah's platform where you will download your Syscoin in the format you chose for delivery (Keypair or wallet.dat). No insecure attachments or emails carrying your actual Syscoin are involved. The Syscoin is downloaded from Moolah's secure environment. Import your coins into your Syscoin wallet We are trying to send out the investor keys/wallets ahead of rolling out the wallet itself publicly. This way investors will be able to load their wallet as soon as they download the wallet client on launch day.

As long as one node is still running you'll be able to get your data back after importing your keypair into any given wallet. The Syscoin team will have at least one official node running, and if for whatever reason that is going to come down, we will let people know. Also via merged mining, it would take everyone abandoning Syscoin/Scrypt for your data to be lost (no nodes running). We should implement a 1-click data backup (all data- certs, offers, data, aliases) within the the wallet client... I think we'll try to do that These are the types of scenarios where its like ""this is new territory, expect some challenges"" but that's the exciting part. It's also why we're testing so much before launching. Don't want to promise too much but we've kicked around the idea of ""Proof-of-Data"". Essentially some nodes would have the option of storing the full blockchain while others would just get data about block value/contents but not the full block data-payload. Those who run the full chain would get a small reward for this, kinda of like PoS but not based on staking coins, more based on hosting data.

You sign these guys up manually so thats the centralization part, but without it all pos chains or even non pow chains that dont rely on a build up of difficulty are vulnerable to attacks, double spends etc. So this leads me to my initial question which went un answered. Assuming everyone is running full nodes at start, and since every feature besides data store is negligible in terms of storage since moores law allows disk us to manage an increase of blockchain bloat by a large percentage, and we are nowhere near the peak of disk storage efficiency.. the one I see a problem with is data store which will fast outgrow any pace of technology advances. If you store data on the blockchain, does everyone get that data or are there smart clients that pull only their data to reduce bloat? The drawback of smart clients is that if i lose my pvt key from hack or whatnot or change wallets i lose my data.. so there is more coupling between private key and external entities which may not be viable for this feature. How did datacoin solve this? i personally dont consider data stored and updated based on private key a feature that satisfied the requirement of a ""decentralized data storage mechanism"" that warrants an r&d fund but it is a good start like maybe a beta, however a nice storyboard of feature sets would be nice to see where they are at and what the end goal is.. werent we promised a whitepaper prior to the IPO?",1001000,Hero Member,sidhujag,04:36:25,2014-07-20,770,3152,37,[ANN] Syscoin - Business on the Blockchain - LAUNCHED!

3,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=432090.0,160,929,dragnar,"""Credits released ->More updates to come"" Hello fellow Miners, Collectors and Traders.   Welcome to Credits. The coin of the Future! You already know this coin as 9Nyan (Nyn), but due to recent developments though, we were forced to remove that name from the coin and repurpose the coin to a new meaning and reason to exist. There are many things we could have done, and one of them was to just up and quit. However that would have been terrible for all the people who helped support us before the bad news came out. It was terrible how it all turned out, but ever since then we have found new meaning for the coin and have come up with Credits!   Credits (CRD) will use your already existing 9Nyan (Nyn) and all previous coins mined from Nyn will be used instead towards this new and great ""coin"".   We use the name Credits, because as sci-fi fans, we have always recognized the need for a proper name for a proper currency. It rolls of the tongue and sounds natural. Think about it. Ask yourself how many Credits you have. If you already have NYN, then you have Credit. Be rejoiceful fellow miner. You are already one step closer to being rich with Credits.   The process is simple. Just back up your wallet.dat file from 9Nyan (NyN). We recommend at least twice. Once for your new client, and once more for just incase of a possible mistake made while installing new client. We would hate to see you lose your shiny new Credits due to a small mistake, so please have at least two backups. Now before you proceed with the following instructions please locate your client folder. In windows this would be called your roaming folder, but in osx it has another name. As for the linux users, we wish we knew how to find that folder, but we are windows/osx users and apologize for not being able to list yours here. If you could let us know how to reach the proper folder we will add it right away.   Windows ""C:\Users\yourcomuterusername\AppData\Roaming"" or alternatively you can type %appdata% into your startmenu and click the roaming folder that shows up. linux /Home/username/.""coinname"" Osx /Users/YourUsername/Library/Application\ Support/nyancoin   tutorials for osx folder can be found here:  http://www.macworld.com/article/2057221/how-to-view-the-library-folder-in-mavericks.html and here: http://www.finerthings.in/featured/lion-library-folder-visible/   Once your done backing up the wallet. remove that old 9nyan (Nyn) client and startup your new Credits (CRD) client. From there let it sync. and then close it. Now your going to go replace that new Credits (CRD) clients wallet.dat file with your old 9Nyan (NYN) wallet.dat file. This is were possible mistake could be made and why we asked that you make two backups for just in case. So please be careful to not hit that delete key. Would be a real shame to lose all that Credits (CRD).   Now that you have replaced the wallet.dat file with the old 9Nyan (Nyn) wallet.dat file, load up the client again, and rejoice as it syncs up and shows that you are now rich with Credits (CRD). Once you see your proper amount shown now as Credits (CRD), You should make a new backup, but before that, please make sure to put a security key on your new client, that is of course if you didn't already have one on your old wallet. once that has been done and you have reloaded your client yet again if you didn't have a security key go ahead and get rid of those old 9Nyan (NyN) wallet.dat files. Replace them with your new backup of Credits (CRD) and be content in knowing that should your client ever have an issue, that your wallet is safe.   Congratulations. You are now a credit owner and are holding a part of the Key To The Future. Happy mining and may we all prosper with Credits (CRD). But don't go running off yet..... Please read below!   Now as a special bonus, we still have the previous premine from the old coin, and are going to be divying it out still just like before, however we are going to be doing a few things a bit differently. First of all, nothing is given freely however. There will always be some sort of effort involved. Even faucets will have some type of challenge. This is mostly meant to help the people with weaker hashrates out there manage to get some credits too before the difficulty gets too high for them. But we don't want people to be able to game the system and there fore we are going to be hosting all sorts of contests, tournaments and daily riddles for give aways.     And finally, anyone who is willing or able to contribute to this wonderful project will be able to earn Credits (CRD) as well, and the more helpful members can become developers as well. Please keep updated to the site to be able to find out what is needed to be done and when so that you have the best chances possible in earning those Credits (CRD)   A few things that can be told off the bat, are that we need:   Nodes for blockchain. We have some, but more are always needed and appreciated.   Pools, and good ones as well.   Meme's and media: We have a special project in mind that you can find out more about on the new freenode channel #CRD. Ask for a dev and we will fill you in asap. This is a top secret project at the moment. If done well, it will pay out well.   and finally, Miners. we need many miners. The difficulty is low right now guys and gals, so come get your Credits while you still can get them easily.   Sincerely, the Credits (CRD) dev team.       Credits released ->More updates to come Official website: http://futurecredits.org/ IRC Channel #CRD or use the web based client http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#CRD   Coin specifications Algo: Scrypt Total Blocks: 10,010,010 Total Credits:337,337,337 Block Reward: 33,7 Block Times: 30 Seconds Confirmations Mined Blocks: 70 Transaction Confirmations: 6 Port: 17778 RPCPort: 17779 Starting Diff: 0.0002 Retarget time: 1 hour   Block Rewards Block 1 = 37 Million Credits - (Only block pre-mined, read the text below for explanation) Rest of the blocks = 33.7 Credits Random Lucky Block rewards are either 137 or 337 or 1337 Â Credits   Windows Wallet   http://futurecredits.org/crd.zip   Mac OSX Wallet   http://futurecredits.org/Credits-Qt.dmg   GITHUB   https://github.com/creditCRD/Credit-master Block Chain Explorer: http://blockchain4credits.tk Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCrd",1187842,Sr. Member,dragnar,19:28:42,2014-01-25,280,6372,1,[ANN] 9Nyan ASCENDED to CREDIT

Just from a Zipf's Law perspective, I think it's likely that a single person will put in at least 8% of the total investment into the fundraiser, so the largest ether holder will likely not be a founder. Also, the big difference from Bitcoin (and especially the 100% premined/fundraised Ripple and Mastercoin) is that, once again, the currency is linear-inflationary, so the percentages will go down over time.

Here the point is really different, this is not a so-called, classic, ""2nd gen coin"", with all of the things related...this is supposed to be a normal alt-coin with SHA-256 algorithm!!! So, let me summarize: - You decided to make a new SHA-256 alt coin. - You decided to premine it. (nothing new so far) - You invented a new kind of premine: instead of doing it the classic way, you are asking ppl to give you BTC to buy ""rigs"" for a total of 100 GHash power, to use this ""rigs"" to premine your own just made altcoin...and you promise to give back to those investors a certain quantity of your new and unknown and so without value alt coin. What will happen in this dreamland scenario? - You get a bunch of BTC (you asked for 1% = 1 BTC so you want 100 BTC) -> total value ~100k $ - You buy an ASIC of 100 GHash power -> total value ~ roughly 2BTC so 2k $ * You send back to the investors some of your scamcoin that is going nowhere anyway - You use the ASIC to mine some more BTC after your shitcoin is dead NB. the * step is optional. Double profit, double scam. I must admit you should've thought a bit to setup such a funny way to tell ppl: hey, I don't want to just scam you once, but twice!!

NxW is part of the KLONE experiment! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423647.0 Open, Free and Fair Trade For All! ""One of the reasons NxW is groundbreaking is because it gives the economy back to the people and re-establishes them as their own sovereigns over their destiny.  An economy is an expression of a political ideology.  Do not mistake us as just another cryptocurrency.   We are a movement."" Complete Fair Distribution - Zero Cost Buy In ! There is no cost to acquire coins, only your interest would suffice! Post ""interested"" as below. NxW is the first 100% Proof-of-Stake (PoS) currency.  Coins are earned solely by charging transaction fees.  Unlike other currencies with PoS mining, NxW's PoS mining does not cause monetary inflation.  The total amount of NxW in circulation is 3 million.  NxW is resistant to +90% attacks via its transparent mining algorithm. NxW improves different features of Bitcoin, removes some disadvantages (e.g. bloated blockchain) and resolves a big environmental issue.  Time between blocks is one minute.  This increases the rate of orphaned blocks, but makes it more convenient for the users. NxW doesn’t use so-called “scripts” aka predicates.  This simplifies and accelerates transaction processing.  Advanced features like multisig will be created on top of the core as 3rd party services. NxW is routable through Tor and I2P anonymous networks. NxW improves on Nxt by providing the following enhancements: Block Chain stored in database.  Unlike Nxt,  NxW does not fail due to out of memory errors. Secure Wallet.  Unlike Nxt,  NxW does not expose the wallet to the open internet. Bitcoin like Addresses.  Unlike Nxt,  NxW adds checksums to addresses so some random number can't be confused as being a NEX address. Multi Precision arithmetic.  Unlike Nxt,  NxW allows up to 8 decimal places.  Nxt does not have decimal places. NxW supports the following features: - Decentralized Alias System / DNS - Complete      Register names and assign them to URIs.  URIs can be anything from web addresses to NEX account numbers.  These aliases will be tradeable in the near future. - Basic DDoS Protection - Complete - Decentralized Asset Exchange / Colored Coins - Done, but not yet implemented.      This allows gateways to issue assets on the NEX network.  These assets can include cryptocurrencies (BTC, LTC, etc), fiat currencies (USD, EUR, RMB, etc), stocks and other assets. - Transparent Mining - Complete.      Transactions are encrypted.  Only PoS block generator can decrypt transactions. - Arbitrary Messaging - Complete. Implementation on block 40,000. - Instant Transactions - Requires peer review - Decentralized Marketplace / Auction - In progress      Buy or sell goods/services in a distributed manner.  All listings are broadcast to all nodes on the network in P2P fashion. - Distributed Storage - In progress - Multi-signatures - In progress - Blockchain Shrinking - In progress - Two-phase Payments - In progress      Software supported escrow transactions - Voting System - In progress - Reputation System - Will be implemented after Voting System      Account trust rating system.  Check if sellers on the distributed exchange have a good history, if stock issuers pay dividends and if gateways honor their asset redemptions. - Decentralized Mixing Service - Concept not ready - Cryptographers please contact core dev team members - Distributed Computing - Concept not ready - Smart Contracts - Concept not ready - Hardware Wallets - Conceptual Stage - Java smart card developers please contact core dev team members - Advanced DDoS Protection: Project Kharon - Conceptual Stage - Neural net programmers please contact core dev team members NxW need you to spread the words. The sources can be taken from NXT or its clone NEX We inherit code from the ""open source"" or ""decompiled"" version of NXT Unlike NXT,  all the decompiled code can be found here:   https://github.com/slothbag/nxt-decompiled  for your review and scrutiny. Please Run a NxW Node If you can run a NxW node, it will help us stabilize and secure the network.  If you have invested in NxW, it is beneficial to you to run a VPS to help to secure the NxW network.  Hallmarking your node helps the network, but is not necessary.

For all the hyper-links, you can go to our clone brother https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=422052.0 Security Tips - Do NOT use the passphrase for your NxW account on a VPS client.  Only use your NxW passphrase on a local NxW client.  Even if you connect to your VPS securely via SSH, you are still not safe because all VPSs have backdoors. - 7874 (tcp) is used for P2P communication, the http web client and API commands.  This is the only port that needs to be open to run NxW. - 7875 (tcp) is used for the https web client.

We see Gold, Silver and Platinum as potential real payment systems in the future, unlike most coins however our premine will be invested in real Gold, Silver and Platinum to give long term real world value to our currencies. Our SilverBars are created to be mined across a 50 year period ensuring these are always in demand, always rare and will ensure a greater value whether its person to person or on an exchange. Each of our 384,000,000 (384 million) bars represents all of the gold bars currently ingotted and stored in any part of the world - around 120,000,000 bars - and a further 264 million bars yet mined from the precious earth). Due to tjhe potential high value of these bars, we will offer a secure storage facility for your gold coins when mined to ensure that you never lose these valuable deposits. Value The value of One Bar Of Silver in real terms is over $1,380 dollars compared to Platinum ($460,000 dollars per bar) and Gold (over $600,000 dollars per bar), what will our cryptocurrency be valued to.......?

New coins are popping up everywhere and dies as quick as 1 day after launch. Because they do not take much effort to make. If it lives, then good lets keep going. If dies, well no big deal. Because this whole cryptocurrency concept and practice, in general, is far from well established yet, anything with large premine(1%+), should be automatically flagged as scam by EVERYONE, and I am one of them (In fact my target is 0.5%). I mean who are you to launch a coin and to say it is or will worth anything? Nobody can. That is why everybody feels that a premine will mostly function as an ""insurance"" for the devs, to say it nicely. Remember the premine is supposed to be only used for promoting the coins for the lifetime of the coin, well, at least until it is got all mined out, which won't happen for decades. Until then, those premined coin will just sit in devs wallet. Ok suppose I am an black-hearted dev and I will do the following: 1: Tweak the specs and wallets of the existing coins. 2: Announce it some unique features but mostly backed up with meaningless theory and concepts. 3: Mark it with fancy promises, meaningless and misleading claims, and get some video or websites to make it look more serious, and maybe absolutely lies if necessary, like who I am and I have a big team or whatever who knows. 4: Tell everyone I am gonna premine it. And claim it will be used for some noble purposes and I will support this thing no matter what blah blah blah. 5: Lanuch. 7: I know there are people will mine it after launch, perhaps a lot if I did the 1-4 right. 8: And get it to an exchange ASAP. 9: If things do well, great I will be a good dev and keep supporting this, and use the premine for promotions etc... 10: If things go bad at the beginning or even sometime in the future and hard to salvage, well I am black-hearted and never expected much from this thing but cash. OK, I will dump the premine and cash it ASAP and disappear. Then the coin dies. 11: People will complain but not for long because the coin is dead, and I am a disappeared dev. Nothing you can do about it. 12: Also people are taking a big risk by mining it at beginning, for a potential boom of course, so they know how these thing go. If it booms, great. You forget about the premine or whatever because you are making money. If it dooms, no big deal.",1188109,Full Member,zmhaha,06:10:27,2014-01-16,166,6363,1,SILVER BARS Launching 18th January 2014

Half the people on here can't even construct a proper sentence, but for some reason think we should all hear what they have to say, no matter how asinine the crap they shout over and over. I've got a couple of points, if you care enough to read: (1) These guys are trying to build something interesting here. They've put thought into it and a lot of energy. You need to learn how to respect someone else's work, even if you disagree with it. If the whole world operated like the people posting on Bitcointalk, we would live in a real-life idiocracy. Take a step back and realise you're just smearing crap on the walls someone else built through hard work - what have you done? (2) If you do come to the conclusion that you don't like the project, that's fine. Try and make a statement that's rational and move on. People are shouting about devs demanding millions of dollars when nobody is demanding anything, how young Vitalik is when that has zero impact on anything (can't imagine what you were like at 19 - Lord help us), or this totally irrational obsession with premine = bad when the roads you drive on and the water you drink got premined and delivered to your tires and orifices through some type of social organisation. (3) We don't live in a fantasy world where devs are free. People need to eat and can't develop something as significant as this project over many years without getting paid. The BTC raised will be completely transparent and go to actually making this happen (and that'll be transparent as well). If you knew anything about project development, let alone cryptocurrency development, you would know how incredibly hard it is to find competent developers. They have those and the contacts to get more. In fact, if you did a little bit of research, you would know there's constant activity of totally open code being written on a near daily basis already. (4) The founders need to have a vested interest, just like developers. They are the ones who will champion this project harder than anyone else. If there's no incentive for them to do so, what's the point? The founders are going to dedicate years of their lives to growing this project and creating value through building something that's novel. Most projects to date have been amateur hour, and the bar is being set pretty high with Ethereum - maybe that explains all the butthurt some people have about it. How about you look into what each of the founders have contributed to this community? I think you'll get a pretty good understanding of how significant this project is for the larger and future ecosystem if you do. tl;dr Respect someone's hard work, learn to move on if you disagree, understand that making cool things costs money, and look at the bigger picture.",1188129,Sr. Member,_ingsoc,16:48:46,2014-01-25,260,6371,31,"Ethereum: 2nd gen cryptocurrency with contract programming, ""dagger"" hashing"

If a certain operation can be done much more efficiently than others, its fee should not depend on how efficiently the other operations can be done.

621,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412878.540,160,62741,tacotime,"There is SO much confusion here about the initial price. Molecular has explained previously that the price relative to BTC does not matter, and he is correct. The only thing that matters is the total amount of BTC that is raised. Let me try to explain, by analogy to how startups raise money in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. When a startup raises capital, they set a ""pre-money"" valuation for the company. All this means is a value for the company that the founders and the investors agree on, BEFORE the new money goes in. If the company raises $2 million on an $8 million pre-money valuation, then the post-money valuation is $8+2 = $10 million, because you have the existing value of the company, plus the new cash. Since the investors paid $2 million for their stake in a $10 million company, they own 20% of the company. If the company raises more money in the future, new shares are issued, and the first set of investors owns a smaller % of the company (i.e. they get diluted, as do the founders). Now, let's leave aside mining for a moment and look JUST at the IPO for Ethereum. After the IPO, if investors put in X BTC, there will exist a TOTAL of 1.5X BTC worth of Ether (the units don't matter, just look at it in BTC or percentage terms). Let's simplify for a second and assume the founders retain the entire extra 0.5X (they don't technically own all of it, but they do control all of it -- see (*) below). This means the investors will own 2/3 of the resulting ""company,"" while the founders will own 1/3. So, regardless of how much money is raised, the founders are selling exactly 2/3 of their company. But this means that the valuation they're raising at is NOT fixed. Since the post-money valuation is 1.5X BTC, and the investors put in X BTC, the pre-money valuation must be 0.5X BTC. But that's not a fixed number: the more interest in the IPO, the higher the resulting valuation they raise money at (in direct linear proportion). If 1000 BTC of money wants to get in, then investors are collectively valuing the existing company at 500 BTC. But if 10,000 BTC wants to get in, then it must mean the company was worth 5,000 BTC initially. That's definitely not the way startups typically raise money, but it is not completely absurd, either. The more VCs that are competing to put money into a startup, the higher the valuation is going to be. The difference here, though, is that all the money doesn't go in at once. Only the people who invest BTC at the very end of the 60-day window will know approximately the actual valuation at which they're investing. The people who invest early on, might think they're getting 1% of the resulting company, but end up only getting 0.1% of the company. If they chose to, the founders could address this in two ways. One way is to have an explicit pre-money valuation cap, of, say, 5,000 BTC. Then, the founders would receive min (0.5X, 5000) BTC worth of Ether, but they could end up owning less than 1/3 of the company. The other way would be to put a cap on the amount they're willing to raise in the IPO. If they committed to raise no more than 10,000 BTC, then the pre-money valuation is capped at 5,000 BTC, but the founders also guarantee they will still own 1/3 of the resulting company. This would be easy to do: simply return investments once 10,000 BTC had been reached. The benefit of both these approaches is that ALL investors, early and late, know the maximum they are paying for the company. I do think it would be wise for the founders to do something of this nature, since it strains the imagination that a company which hasn't actually yet launched a product should be worth more than about $10 million (and even by Silicon Valley standards, that's a stretch). There's also a limit to how much and how quickly a large amount of capital could actually be effectively used. If they somehow raise $100M of BTC, it'd be awfully tempting just to split it up and go sit on a beach in a non-extradition country somewhere...  So, just spare yourselves the temptation, guys. :-) Ideally, the investors would also effectively have preferred shares. For instance, let's say that BTC value skyrockets, and the foundation is sitting on more BTC than they could ever use effectively. They decide to issue a BTC dividend proportionately to all Ether holders (somehow). In a perfect world, the investors would have to first get their BTC back before the founders' Ether got paid any dividend. That's exactly how it works for startups, but I'm guessing it may not really be that feasible here. However, I do think it's important that the founders can't simply pay the BTC to themselves. They should publicly commit to never use the IPO BTC to pay themselves beyond a basic salary -- but ideally, even their salaries should be almost entirely in Ether. (*) I assumed above that the founders own 0.5X BTC, or 1/3 of the resulting company. Actually, they only own 0.225X, and 0.275X is reserved for paying employees, issuing bounties, etc. You can think of this 0.275X as more analogous to the employee stock option pool of a company. It's not actually in the hands of the employees yet, but the company can issue it later to pay for services. This doesn't really change the pre-money valuation calculations above, but it does mean that the founders themselves actually only own 15% (0.225/1.5) of the resulting company, not 1/3 as used above. The ""company"" owns the other 18.3%. (**) All this is before mining starts. Think about mining as ongoing employee stock option issuance (payment for services rendered). Of course one can certainly argue whether 0.4X per year is a reasonable amount for mining or not. Or whether PoW is better than PoS, yadda yadda yadda.",1188184,Member,bpd,02:30:16,2014-01-24,114,6371,28,"Ethereum: 2nd gen cryptocurrency with contract programming, ""dagger"" hashing"

For instance, let's say it's 10,000 BTC per ETH, and 500 BTC is given to Ethereum and co. 0.05 ETH (500 BTC / 10,000 BTC) is then given to the preminers investing (0.225 X), and in the first year and every year after, ~0.09 ETH (0.400 X) will be mined by miners.

I don't know but perhaps a reasonable explanation will be forthcoming. We can only speculate. The start value of ETH is actually irrelevant as has been explained by other members previously in the thread. 100 apples at a dollar each or 10 apples at 10 dollars doesn't really matter. The bottom line does not change. Maybe the dev group felt they should be working with a smaller post IPO number since a large fraction of raised ETH will be mined for years to come. A larger number may psychologically inhibit forward price movement. Just maybe they sat down with all kind of scenarios with their spreadsheets and felt a smaller number is better. I am sure they didn't pull it out of a hat. Also all aspects of the project are subjected to change until the project is open to public. Surely they have that much liberty.

I guess it's mostly the same newbies that still see Bitcoin as just a coin/commodity to invest in, and not a financial platform to develop on top of. Personally, I would invest 20BTC in things like BitMessage and OpenTransactions, despite their ""coins"" themselves not having any value, just because the possibilities they offer as platforms are enormous! I will be investing in this as well. Not because of the possible return on the coins (though I suspect that will still be substantial), and not even because of the initially proposed technology (which, as someone pointed out, is similar to some other coins out there), but because of the team involved. Ask any top VC out there. They don't invest in ideas, they invest in people. It's also why Bitcoin will always be top coin, despite other altcoins constantly coming out with little fixes here and there. The quality, and quantity, of people working on it is way superior to any other alternatives. <rant> As for PoS, I really hope Ethereum doesn't take that route. PoW ""decentralizes"" the act of securing the currency from the currency itself. With PoW, I have a choice to either invest in the currency itself by buying it directly, OR invest in securing the currency by using it to buy mining hardware. There is also absolutely nothing to prevent a new miner from entering and competing with others, regardless of how many coins others hold. As a wealthy coin holder, I can't prevent a PoW miner from coming in and continuing to enforce rules on how I can spend my coins. The most I can do is spend some of my coins to buy some hardware and join him. PoW, on the other hand, incentivises, and in fact directs, the flow of money to one or few people, since you invest in ""mining"" by holding the coins themselves, and continue to increase your wealth by having those same coins collect even more coins. Threat of 51% in PoW is quickly resolved by having miners switch pools and redistribute themselves. Threat of a 51% in PoS can't be fixed by having mining wealth redistributed. Worst case end-game scenario in PoS is wealthy PoS miners continuing to accumulate wealth until they get a majority of the stake, while allowing users to become more and more dependent on their PoS coins, then the wealthy few pool their resources together, create a single, completely controling PoS stake, and change the coin to do whatever they want, including causing it to inflate. If you think PoS owners will be incentivized not to inflate away their wealth, think again. Central Banks around the world are PoS systems, and they do just that, printing more and more to buy up more and more assets, while letting those they sell their inflating money to pay for the inflation. </rant>",1188243,Legendary,Rassah,19:29:22,2014-01-22,1456,6371,25,"Ethereum: 2nd gen cryptocurrency with contract programming, ""dagger"" hashing"

NECESSITY OF A NEW BLOCKCHAIN The whitepaper states that colored coins inherit the same limitations as the bitcoin protocol.  Metacoins do not, but they cannot be truly secure without having a copy of the blockchain.  How big of a problem is this?  Hasn't the Electrum model worked for Bitcoin?  Is there a big issue with just querying a bunch of supernodes to see if they all give the same result?  Is it necessary to have absolute security with every contract, or only very high value transactions?  Is it correct that metacoin clients won't need the first 14gb of the blockchain? BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN SIZE Bitcoin Magazine's analysis showed that since storage capacity and internet bandwidth follow Moore's law, the blockchain size will not be a problem to store on phones.  How many years from now should we predict that the blockchain size will become irrelevant?  If the blockchain size were irrelevant, would that remove the need for ethereum?  How much demand is there for blockchain contracts at this time, and how fast should we expect demand to accelerate? ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN How fast should we estimate the ethereum blockchain size will grow?  What will be the effects of ethereum blockchain size growth several orders of magnitude greater than Bitcoin?  Will this lead to more mining centralisation? TURING COMPLETENESS Is it reasonable to think the client can be sandboxed?  What will be the effects of these, since the protocol is Turing complete:  viruses, malware, adware, keyloggers, scam contracts, wallet stealers ILLEGAL CONTRACTS What will be the effects of illegal contracts? An assassination market, for example?  Will the Silk Road be able to run on ethereum?  Will a database of child porn be able to be stored?  If there is child porn stored on the blockchain that is easily accessible, will it be legal to store the blockchain in any country?  What will be the effects of running all the clients over Tor by default?  Can a 60s block time with huge blocks work over Tor? SATOSHI'S ARGUMENTS In 2010, satoshi succesfully argued against including Namecoin into bitcoin, suggesting merge-mining instead.      ""Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale.      Bitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately.  Users shouldn't have to download all of both to use one or the other.  BitDNS users may not want to download everything the next several unrelated networks decide to pile in either.      The networks need to have separate fates.  BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.""  -- Satoshi You can view the rest of his arguments in the thread here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.0;all DEVELOPER COMMENTS I have not seen any core bitcoin developers comment on ethereum.   Is there somewhere besides the reddit and the thread on bitcointalk about it?

I think rather the point behind it is as a barrier from easy entry, and while it is true that someone may burn a very large sum, unlike with fund-raisers there is no guarantee on the return of that money and thus generally serves as a barrier from monopolistic capitalization. The comparison to Satoshi is unfair, since the obscurity was at least mostly unintentional and though he may have held certain notions as to the Bitcoins future value, there was no real way to know that there would be such value (main-stream adaptation) to Bitcoin and not some other protocol. According to the numbers specified on your website - founders get .25x of x fundraised funds, and the foundation gets .25x of fundraised funds. Which would make the premine supply 1.5X and thus gives .5xXor 33% premine to the founders - plus the equivalent of all fund raised funds in btc. Suppose the developers participate in the fund raiser, they donate some P % of X total btc. They therefore get P + .5P in funds, and all of their BTC back from the foundation. It makes exploitation very clearly possible. And since 33% of initial premine + The entire amount of btc is already a such a sum that can only be explained as Greed - I don't see on what grounds you can convince anyone that you aren't going to exploit the system further.

621,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412878.440,160,62741,tacotime,"I think it's a problem if Ether must be mined. Inflation will take place which will devalue the currency as it's being mined. Inflation should be 0%. In my opinion all the coins that should ever exist should be released at once and if that is not possible then go with Proof of Stake for a certain amount of months or years until Ethereum is popular and widely distributed. The only problem with PoW is the fact it has to inflate and you have to mine it. The security is good but as you see with Bitshares it's better to avoid PoW. That leaves PoS and PoB and in my opinion the best option is a hybrid of the two. The problem with setting a hard cap but not releasing it all at once is, you have the same problem as with the federal reserve. Inflation decreases the value so there is no real benefit in going into Ethereum early if you know it's going to have a high rate of inflation and inflate into the trillions of coins. That is just my opinion. There are advantages to larger numbers for marketing but in my opinion those advantages only make sense if the rate of inflation is very low. Peercoin has a low rate of inflation but has no cap. And with PoB the cap does not even matter anymore because you can destroy the coins to accelerate deflation. If we want to reward the early investors then we want a high rate of deflation and high demand. The total cap is irrelevant.",1188291,Hero Member,Luckybit,23:47:59,2014-01-20,602,6371,23,"Ethereum: 2nd gen cryptocurrency with contract programming, ""dagger"" hashing"

Determine the rate of inflation, the total amount of coins, and the amount of demand. If the rate of inflation is low, the total amount of coins is high, and the demand is high, then it's probably a good investment. But it all depends on the rate of inflation and since we don't know what that will be we cannot know how good or bad of an investment Ethereum will be at IPO. Levelcoin is offering an interesting algorithm with interesting ideas. The main idea is that PoS voting can be used to modulate the rate of deflation for a coin which has a fixed supply. If the supply is inflating then I'm a bit more skeptical it can work. If the supply is fixed such as if you lock the maximum supply in at the start (0% rate of inflation), then you can deflate your currencies as a way to increase demand and as destroy the coins as the block reward (if you destroy the coins as a block reward then the reward is dispersed to all coin holders like PoS).

Because BTC is mined and is inflating, our buying power is constantly being reduced to benefit miners. The miners actually benefit the most from inflation while everyone holding Bitcoins benefits from deflation. Supply and demand influence price so deflation will create higher prices if demand increases. It's safe to say that for Bitcoin demand is definitely going to continue to increase so everyone will benefit from PoB.

Greed! Guys, this coin is not especially useful for getting rich quick and I predict you will have all the time in the world to buy/mine it if you want in the years after launch because of the linear inflation. There will be no halving of the reward, inflation in relative terms only goes down due to the increasing supply. This means miners in year 1 will get the same amount of coin as miners in year 20. This coin is innovative technically and founders have chosen not to make early adopters extremely rich in the long run. Since this (early adopter unfairness) is often cited as a drawback of Bitcoin (envy) by newcomers and some economists, I think this could turn out to be a good decision...

Basically the only way it can be exploited is insta-mining where a coin launches with a far too low diff, and even this can be combated by anticipating it and setting the starting diff higher, or low block rewards early.  and even this 'insta-mining' is only really centralized/unfair for a few days, within a few weeks the overall mining reward has diluted the first instamining I'm not sure how a fixed algo, no matter what, will be resistant to ASICs.  It sounds like needing a bunch of RAM is just going to make it just like the other CPU coins, botnets and cloud mining.

In long run most of the transactions will pass through the genesis investors, making them a Visa / PayPal (?) of sorts, and continuing growing their holdings without any additional investment from their side. Compare this to BTC, where ASIC's arms race forces the miners to continuously invest more of their gains back into ASIC mining, thus distributing the network and making it more secure. By the way, note that such feature (inherently unfair to anyone joining after genesis) was again - added at will of the genesis investors. If a similar feature was put to voting say in MSC protocol, I'm not sure at all it would pass, due to the distribution: http://mastercoin-explorer.com/addresses While you may have a point about IPO price or getting back to ASIC dependency, as long as Vitalik and the team do not create artificial shortage by breaking on their own announcement (which exactly what NXT did), a much larger amount of people have a fair chance to join the IPO early, and spread the gains proportionally.

It doesn't matter if the IPO price is 1 BTC or 0.0001 BTC or one satoshi. The IPO price per unit does not matter at all and the ""projected supply of 1.2 trillion"" you are using to estimate wether or not that price is too high or too low implicitly contains that initial price: If the price was 1 BTC / ether initially the ""1.2 trillion 'cap'"" would be 120 Million instead. It doesn't make sense at all to argue about the initial price. The only variable that could be ""too high"" or ""too low"" is the amount of BTC investors invest initially. Since this variable is determined by the collective opinion of the the same people that will henceforth trade ETH, it will be chosen ""exactly right"". This is the main difference (in my mind) compared to the NXT issuance model. With NXT the amount of coins was fixed and the price got implicitly decided by the amount of BTC people put in. With ETH the price is fixed, but the amount that will be issued is not. (also NXT ipo was too short and invisible and maybe was even closed early, that's why price shot up afterwards. Had they waited long enough with high exposure to and broad discussion by the public, price would've been ""exactly right"" after ipo) I'm not sure which assumptions are used to arrive at 1.2 trillion. Let's make another calculation: Investors put in 25,000 BTC, so x = 25,000 / 0.0001 = 250 Million ether. Henceforth 0.5x = 125 Million ether will be mined each year, so after ~50 years, we're looking at 6.25 Billion ether. We're looking at 12.5 Billion ether in the long run (~100+ years) assuming 1% annual loss due to carelessness, death, etc... What does matter is the amount of BTC investors put in initially. This sets an initial ""market cap of ether expressed in BTC"" with an arbitrarily chosen initial price of 0.0001 BTC/ether. This market cap reflects what ""the market"" thinks about ethereum value at that point in time. After that I'm guessing mining and trading will start. Assuming that it's possible to invest exactly up to the point when mining/trading starts, the price of 0.0001 BTC/ether should be exactly what the market thinks the price should be at that time. After that point (assuming a well-functioning exchange) it should adjust according to peoples changes in valuation of ethereum. There shouldn't be any ""shooting up"" or ""crashing down"" of BTC/ETH. tell me if I'm wrong.",1188636,Legendary,molecular,07:48:05,2014-01-16,1610,6371,11,"Ethereum: 2nd gen cryptocurrency with contract programming, ""dagger"" hashing"

The only difference this makes is where my invested BTC go. In the former case they go to the ethereum development fund, in the latter they go to a genesis investor.

I'll be absolutely happy if the devs became billionairs IF they deserve it. Only a naive fool would say they deserve anything right now without showing anything in action. The devs are asking to be paid on two fronts, one being an IPO which everyone despises and are known to be used by scammers since there is no turning back once you've sent the cash, and two with a huge supply of currency that they can dump after a year. If Ether is poised to be the next big thing, why do they need an IPO? Especially one that uses an untraceable BTC purchase. If they had such an ingenious system, why wouldn't the IPO be done with USD or EUR. That way we are at least protected if it is a scam? If I were a dev and I knew that my product was going to be amazing, I'd be satisfied with the millions I would make with my currency. If I were a dev and I felt that the project would fail, or that it had no value, or that I was planning to release it then go on vacation to the Bahamas, then I would do a BTC IPO so that I can at least secure some money at the expense of everyone that trusted me. This may or may not be the case here, which is why I said there is NO way to absolutely sure. No one is being given the benefit of the doubt. So the only logical step would be to cancel the IPO entirely or until the product is launched. eMunie did this, and I have to give Fuserleer huge props for doing so. I'd be contradicting myself if I were against them, but for this. Not to mention that people don't understand how the coding system seems to be implemented. Ethereum is claiming to be Turing complete. Turing complete means that Ethereum contracts will likely be absolutely loaded with common and proprietary viruses, keyloggers, malware, adware, and a slew of other bad things. I am willing to bet my bank account that in a few short months people will be crying about how they got all their wallets/currency stolen, or their computers are now running slow, or how they blue screen every few minutes after a reboot. If you want an example of how Turing complete works, load up a peer to peer sharing program and download a bunch of .MOV files and run them. I GUARANTEE that you will get a virus. That's because Quicktime movie files are Turing complete. This is why mkv, mpeg, mpg and avi, while not impervious, are much much safer to download. If you want to invest, mine, and run contracts at the risk of losing everything then go ahead. We will never know for sure how secure Ether is going to be until post release, so asking for money without proof of security is another red flag.

In Bitcoin, transactions are very cheap to validate, and nodes have little to no advantage to refuse checking and broadcasting them. On the contrary, some Ethereum contracts might be quite expensive to execute, and while miners do have the incentive to do this - the transaction fees, which are relatively high, - ordinary nodes don't. If we assume that nodes are rational, they may refuse to evaluate and rebroadcast complex contracts transactions that do not affect themselves, because this would reduce load on their computers and will not result in any penalties. Additionally, high transaction fees favour selfish mining ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243 ).

621,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412878.120,160,62741,tacotime,"Hey all, Vitalik Buterin, founder here. Thanks a lot tacotime for making the thread and representing us. I actually did just formalize the PoS algorithm I had briefly sketched out this morning: http://blog.ethereum.org/?p=39/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm .If we get real overwhelming demand to use proof of stake, we will use something like this or something better, but that's not really likely IMO. An interesting idea there would be to also add some kind of proof-of-excellence based distribution model (eg. we'll put 10000 trillion ether into a contract which gives ether to people who solve very hard math and CS problems like integer factorization, AI board game algorithms, etc) so we still have some more issuance over time and aren't 100% premined. Now, to get to the main point, the issuance model. First, as mentioned by LeoC, proof of burn is a non-starter for our use case, because PoB cannot be independent. That is to say, with PoB an Ethereum client would need to also have a Bitcoin blockchain and would be dependent on the Bitcoin blockchain for validity checking. I absolutely do not want to have external dependencies in Ethereum - with the obvious exception of people creating SPV clients inside of contracts, which I think is a really cool idea with amazing potential for cross-chain atomic swaps, two-way pegs and the like. Second, and more importantly, while I do understand the sentiment that cryptocurrency algorithms should be neutral and privilege no specific parties I would like to contest the claim that the concept of neutrality in the context of issuance is both (1) possible and (2) desirable. When you're putting BTC into the Ethereum fundraiser, you're financially empowering and incentivizing an organization that has produced substantial real results already, and is pledged to developing the Ethereum protocol. When you're putting BTC into a proof of burn, through the deflation effect you're effectively donating your money to large BTC early adopters. When we talk about neutrality and fairness, what we really mean is that we want the currency supply to be distributed among as many large and diverse constituencies as possible. And this is actually the reason why I came up with Ethereum's compromise distribution model. With Bitcoin, the only way to get BTC was mining, and so BTC privileges the class of people with computing power. With Mastercoin, it was buying into the fundraiser, privileging the Bitcoin-wealthy. With Ripple, it's working for Ripple Labs or getting a bit at a giveaway, privileging the founders. With Ethereum, there are many ways to get ether: you can participate in the fundraiser, you can participate in the Ethereum project and receive salaries or bounties, you can mine, and we may potentially even end up doing a giveaway or two. This actually increases fairness compared to the pure mining model, since different groups of people are privileged in each of these categories (people with money, people with hardware, people with connections and development skills, etc) and all of these have a chance. With regard to the ""founders get some for free"" factor, what people need to understand is that every currency, including BTC, QRK, MSC and Ripple, so far has privileged its founders in some fashion. The only difference is that in some cases the privilege is more subtle than in others. With Bitcoin, Satoshi got his 0.25X by mining it for a year when nobody else had heard about Bitcoin yet. With MSC, JR got his by running a fundraiser relatively quietly on Bitcointalk and then targeting media attention only after it was over. We are not seeking any avantage through obscurity; we will be targeting the limelight from before the first day that the fundraiser launches. Ultimately, our ideology with regard to the distribution long-term is this. We believe that centralization and decentralization both have their value, and must be used at the appropriate times. Startups, in practice, generally have to be dictatorial. However, institutions that are at the base level of society should ideally not be controlled by anyone. To that end, the way that we are structuring both the organization and the issuance model is that we will have a large amount of influence at the beginning, but that influence will quickly decay over time as the years progress. Once we release the coin, we will inevitably immediately lose control, and over the next one or two years we even hope to turn the Ethereum organization itself into a DAO, sustaining itself through VC-like investments with ownership spread among thousands of people in the community. It's the same with the profit structure; yes, if Ethereum succeeds, we will profit handsomely, and fundraiser participants will profit handsomely. However, because we have permanent linear inflation, this profit is a one-time fact whose importance in the system will diminish to zero over a sufficiently long period of time. As T approaches infinity, ether becomes zero percent premined. Satoshi, on the other hand, has up to 5% of all BTC forever. All in all, we believe that we have come up with a very interesting issuance model that combines together the benefits of all of the various models in small doses; we have Ripple-style premining, Mastercoin-style fundraising, but ultimately Bitcoin-style mining dominates over the long term, eventually coming to eclipse every other component of the issuance. It is ultimately up to the community to decide whether or not this issuance model is valuable. Now, to clarify some facts: * The founders will not be getting any BTC from the pool. We may get some not particularly high wages to live on, but our financial interest in the project is heavily concentrated in the value of our premine share. * The founders are not getting 25%. The founders are getting 12.5% after one year when those funds actually become accessible, and the percentage will rapidly dwindle due to supply expansion, becoming 6.25% after 5 years. I'm sure that there exist five people today who together own 6.25% of all bitcoins, and Satoshi alone likely has that much. In Mastercoin, three people have 25% . * The BTC from the pool will be going entirely to the organization, and we will start using it to pay expenses even as the fundraiser is running in order to get development moving quickly. We have plans on how we can spend money all the way up to $25 million; the higher-end expenses consist of things like Bitcoin Decentral-style incubators, a large amount of funds into cryptocurrency scalability research, funding very high-quality interfaces, decentralized exchanges, and other such infrastructure, and even funnelling money into projects that might work alongside Ethereum (eg. Bitmessage, KryptoKit, OpenTransactions) * We are not trying to be a highly powerful HFT exchange. We are trying to be a generalized workhorse that can do anything. Identity systems, decentralized Dropbox, sub-currencies, you name it. HFT can be done through either a dedicated chain (eg. BitShares can release an Ethereum contract containing an SPV version of the BitShares blockchain and use that to allow units to move back and forth between the two blockchains, and then do HFT on their own chain) or using a semi-centralized system like OpenTransactions * We are going to release clients in 3-4 langugaes, likely Python, Go, C++ and NodeJS. The main reason for this is to avoid monoculture from day one and to ensure consistency since it's very unlikely that the same bug will appear in all four. * We will not put Zerocoin into Ethereum. But what you can do is set up a Zerocoin-based mixer as an Ethereum contract. * We have not figured out how to do 100% trust-free fiat. The closest we've gotten is doing contracts for difference off of voting pools of price feeds. But even that is a massive improvement over having to trust an issuer. * We will likely use 3-of-5 multisig to hold our funds. We will be the first cryptocurrency fundraiser that we know of whose exodus address actually has a 3 at the beginning.",1188710,Sr. Member,Vitalik Buterin,12:16:25,2014-01-15,330,6371,7,"Ethereum: 2nd gen cryptocurrency with contract programming, ""dagger"" hashing"

621,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412878.120,160,62741,tacotime,"Thank you Vitalik for joining the topic. I value your idea, and ultimately your project will be - and start - how you wish it to be. However I am a bit sad you got influenced by LeoC without thinking twice about what he wrote. About proof of burn, you two are just wrong. Let's not mix everything. You both are confuse. PoB is not equal to XCP. Counterparty is only a project using PoB for it's XCP distribution. While I fully agree XCP cannot be independent, that just doesn't apply to PoB by itself. It's a choice. LeoC has a fixation on XCP and answered about XCP where I was talking purely about PoB. Basic example: You take Next, instead of having an IPO, you start with PoB as only way to get NXT. You end with a cryptocurrency fully independent from all the other, relying only on PoS for security. XCP is a metacoin. All metacoin are intrinsically dependent on another blockchain (whatever which one). PoB is a method for wealth transfer and distribution in trustlessness. PoB is not a coin, even less a metacoin. Absolutely nothing prevent Ethereum to use only PoB and remain 100% independent. It's a choice. The reason PoB is a non-starter for most are completely other reason. The main one are: money & 1-time all-coin-created model. Not every currency. All except one. XCP. I suppose the top1 reason that make dev disregarding PoB is that there is less quick/easy benefits for themselves & development instant$ reward/salary. The main problem with PoB is that the dev, the betatester, the investor : EVERYONE is on the same level. Some see that as a problem, some see it the opposite way, 'a much awaited change. All have to risk destroying their money for a possible future gain. The main problem with PoB compare to IPO is that you do not have the possibility of arbitrarily taking x% in order to reserve them for salaries or bounties. In an over simplified way: dev works for free. The only income they might get depend on the amount they burn, the work they provide, the success they help to give to their project, the community work toward this project, etc. For work to be done: - if bounties or salaries, it is from the dev pocket or from the community donation. - otherwise it is for free. Dev, outside dev & everyone all helping each other to their level. IPO & bounties/salaries are very capitalist-based. It's might be free speech (open source) but it's definitely not free beer. Only money matter. With pure PoB, it's definitely closer to ""free speech free beer"". The approach is completely different. It's another mind set. Another approach. Suppose I'm a outside dev. If dev chose IPO and made lots of money, sure as hell I wanna be paid for any work I give to help their project. With pure PoB approach, I tell myself: wow the dev finance everything from the start with their own pocket. Donation is optional, that make me want to give, at least a tiny little. Working for free or very low immediate $reward? yes, I don't mind, it's fits my idea ideal. I wish to support this project that's started on such awesome foundation. It's a real communitarian project. As Vitalik wrote ""It is ultimately up to the community to decide whether or not this issuance model is valuable."" An issuance model can be more or less valuable. But more than that, it's the idea that it represent that is valuable or not. The Style - as I call it - has more or less value. NXT crappy style of distribution (stopped without warning before end time leading on purpose to bad repartition) -> very bad style. I deeply love the 100% PoS idea, but the style, the idea-reflected by NXTdev make that Next has absolutely no value to my eye. It's in total contraction to my idea ideal, therefore I decided to never put money in it. Missed a x27 train, whatever, at least I stay true to myself. Of course the real end value is decided by the global community, not by a single individual. It's up to every single one of you to make your own choice. To support the idea or style that you prefer. In addition to risk, ROI, etc. Of course having $25 millions for development will tend to make it move quicker. It's the same analogy that microsoft vs GNU/Linux, all over again in a new context. Do you wish to work for microsoft and be sure to be paid now? Or do you wish to support the fundamental idea behind open source software? Second option (PoB/no-boutie vs IPO/boutie) will very probably give you less money right now. Yet imagine if a thousands dev choose the second option! You can be pretty sure that on middle/long term, if the basic idea/project are good, everyone is gonna be awesomely rich. The dev, the betatester, the burner, etc. All on the same level: according to what you burn + the global work/pub/success. I'm feed up writing about PoB. And most of those still reading are probably too. So I'm gonna stop talking about PoB. Just wished to make due correction and share my idea/ideal. ('can redirect people to this post in the future) You do not give them anything... Their BTC is not suddenly worth more. It's psychological. At best it's stay as stable as now for them forever. If Ethereum goal were really to remplace bitcoin, which actual capacities to do so: then Bitcoin ultimately will lose value compare to ether over time. Not win. Scarcity alone doesn't fix any value. Lot's of thing I wish to express about Ethereum itself. (this post was a bit off topic) But it will be for another time. I have a life outside this forum. Anyway, best of luck to your project. Whatever it will concretely be at the end. There is still space for communication with the community, and many possible amelioration.",1188712,Full Member,panonym,12:43:38,2014-01-15,238,6371,7,"Ethereum: 2nd gen cryptocurrency with contract programming, ""dagger"" hashing"

So, hopefully over that five year period, ether gains in value by more than double in bitcoin terms or if calculated from inception, greater than 16 times in bitcoin terms .

But I still have not find any answer yet for one of the most critical questions for me: How does Ethereum protect itself from an 51% attack in the bootstrapping phase? A political (non-economical) motivated attacker (Banks, State) could buy in cheap from day 1 with mining a huge portion, stay silent and use the >51% power when they want to break it down. Some altcoins have been killed in the bootstapping phase by such attacks (probably just by someone wanting to demonstrate that its possible). I guess Ethereum is on the radar of people in charge of securing the states/banks power and those people will see the huge potential in it. So I guess the threat is much higher than with all those boring alt coins clones we have seen in the last months...

The issuance rule is like that: 0.0001 BTC for 1 Ether. If people invest all in all 1000 BTC there will be 10 000 000 Ether from fundraising and 50% of that goes to founders/org + 50% to miners per year. So after 1 year you have 20 mio Ether. If they get 10k BTC at fundraising -> 200 Mio Ether; If they get 100k BTC at fundraising (100 mio USD!) -> 2 000 Mio Ether; If they get 1000k BTC at fundraising (1000 mio USD!) -> 20 000 Mio Ether; But thats very unrealistic (10% of btc market cap) In that caseFor mining there would be added 10 000 Mio per year, if you count for 100 years thats 1 000 000 Mio = 1*10^12. So even in a highly unlikely scenario of 1 Mio Btc fundraising there would be only about 10^12 in circulation.

That being said, Vitalik is a really bright guy and I think he'll be the first person to successfully implement contracts and DAOs.  He has a ton of neat ideas for things to use contracts for, and a very fast mind.   My only huge reservation about the alt chain (tree) is that transactions and contracts are kept on the same layer for both security and liability.  I would like to have these things kept separately; I worry that judges/political panels might consider contracts to be an entirely different thing than transactions because they represent actual instructions that may be criminal, and could make their propagation illegal.  This might push the chain/tree over to the dark net; I feel like it'd be safer to potentially have two blocktrees, one for simple Bitcoin like equity transactions, and one for decentralized programming, and to have these two trees interact with and validate one another.  The other thing is that executable code could bring with it some security issues, which also scares me.  But it was just my thoughts on that matter, and it doesn't mean it'll be the case.  I plan to invest some money even he decides this is a silly idea, but I'd feel more comfortable with them split.

621,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412878.40,160,62741,tacotime,"Can you answer some of these comments from Invictus? Our technical team has evaluated the Ethereum proposal and design and have concluded the following: 1) Mining means the DAC will be operating at a loss or break-even at best.  No dividends. 2) Scripts will require more blockchain space and bandwidth resulting in lower transaction volume for the same level of decentralization. 3) We do not believe the scripts can efficiently implement a BitShares like market matching with automatic margin calls at scale.   4) Merged mining would be required to secure parallel chains... this has its own challenges. 5) Mining will result in centralization one block at a time, something very bad for chains that implement markets. 6) Finding GPU developers is hard enough, defining a new dedicated language for this purpose will be even harder. 7) If you eliminate mining, then the cost of launching a new DAC is near 0 and you can simply use C++ to encode your contracts starting from a 'shell DAC' and launch without having to overload everyone not interested in your contract.   NO 'competitor' thus far is willing to admit that multiple parallel blockchains will be required to handle the order of magnitude greater transaction volume an exchange experiences vs Bitcoin and this is for a SINGLE currency pair.  Imagine attempting to have every tradable market on one chain!   This will rapidly be centralized into trusted supernodes that can handle the bandwidth requirements. 9) You think bitcoin verification times have trouble scaling, imagine executing an interpreted language! Conclusion: We believe Ethereum is an interesting computer science project with little compelling advantage in developing new DACs and many drawbacks.   We wish them well and if their scripting language and contract design proves useful as a means for very special purpose contracts then we suspect we will be able to adapt it to a more efficient, profitable, AGS honoring DAC https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1854.msg27154#msg27154",1188787,Full Member,Solidchance,01:30:27,2014-01-14,169,6371,3,"Ethereum: 2nd gen cryptocurrency with contract programming, ""dagger"" hashing"
621,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412878.40,160,62741,tacotime,"There are been some interesting innovations in the proof of stake space with the introduction of Nxt and also BitShares adopting PoS. We feel that mining currently best meets the design decisions we've made for Ethereum, but this does need to be explained in depth and with context. There will be a lag between the fundraiser and the launch for mining thus in the gap, we are going to release an article explaining why we have chosen a mining versus a PoS security model. Should data from Nxt or Bitshares (if released within this timeframe) provide a more convincing counter-argument, we'll have the opportunity to switch. Overall, designing a new cryptocurrency is a game of tradeoffs, economic philosophy and user experience. Ethereum is being developed with the notion of balance in all things from the method of distribution to the security model. Current plans are for a 60 day fundraiser, starting from Miami on; however, we are still exploring this and thus will set something in stone closer to the conference. 1 bitcoin = 100000000 satoshi 1 ether = 1000000000000000000 Wei The unit of account of the system will be ether like bitcoin is the unit of account for the bitcoin ecosystem. Come visit us in Miami. We should have everything ready by then. No, the rate of inflation is always decreasing and comparable with bitcoin. The Total supply formula is as follows TS(t) = 1.5x + 0.5x*t with x being the initial supply and t being time in years. At genesis block TS(0) = 1.5x. Year 1 TS = 2.0x. You'll notice rate of inflation slows over time and we even made this  graph to compare it to bitcoin: The core idea is that the rate of inflation tends towards year and that supply is growing fastest while demand is scaling non-linearly. In terms of ROI, this should be reflected with a positive ROI. No, the founder shares will be given only once like founder stock in a startup and the percentage  founder ownership of the total amount of ether in supply will be 6.25% in year 5, which is a little over half of what Satoshi has of bitcoin. We really wanted to model supply like a startup to big company. The benchmark I used was Bill Gate's holdings of Microsoft going from 64% initially (which is considerably larger than our holdings) to roughly 5 percent or so today. Overall, both gates and Satoshi percentagewise are doing better. Finally, founder shares cannot be spent for a locked period of time that's hard coded into Ethereum. Thus, we can't sell our Ether until long after the ecosystem is bootstrapped. I'm not going to fully address Dan's concerns here. The questions he listed indicate they either didn't read or didn't comprehend the whitepaper. For example, the entire philosophy of Ethereum is to be a base layer for innovation thus the particular economic model of a DAC running on top of Ethereum is beyond the scope of our design. A person could indeed have dividends in a sub-currency, yet this point seems to have been missed or ignored. As for P2P exchange, we have a close relationship with Open Transactions and combined with a namecoin style contract provided in the whitepaper and bitmessage makes a significantly more efficient distributive exchange than is possible with BitShares. Trust is not required as auditing can be done on Ethereum blockchain and we wouldn't suffer any bloat.   Things like 7 again demonstrate either a lack of comprehension or ignorance of our design, contracts are more than robust enough to launch a proof of stake subcurrency. 6 seems to ignore ethereum script is turing complete and thus you can compile a language like c++ into it (anyone ever used coffeescript to write js)? On a side note, I am honestly curious how Invictus intends on building DACs without a turing complete language? It seems like you would end in an infinite inductive process of having to build a bigger feature set for the next set of DACs. I guess they have a different philosophy and this is fine.

Or are you further down the implementation stage that you let out? 2) If capital dilution is baked in, surely this means the valuation of Ether needs to climb at a proportional rate or else both founders + investors would lose out over time? 3) Why use 12m time lock with dilution instead of a staggered time lock (this would make it much more akin to a standard startup reverse vesting process) Having the risk of core members bailing out at 12 months is not reassuring. 4) Do you plan / reserver the right to further rounds later on? 5) When are we going to get a full list of the people involved?

621,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=412878.40,160,62741,tacotime,"ROI is ultimately connected to the demand for coins and it is our belief long term that the utility presented will be significant thus driving demand. I suppose it will depend upon your time horizon and also market perception. Ethereum will not be transferable until mining begins and I would expect enormous volatility during the first few trading days; however, I reject the notion of immediate liquidation. Should the product be well formed it appears highly likely many people who missed or passed on the fundraiser will want to invest while prices are still low. My goal is not to make investors money immediately after mining begins. My goal is to offer a product that will have a healthy ROI over some reasonable period of time (say 6-12 months). The only way to accomplish this is to ensure the ecosystem is well developed and provides real value. Website is still buggy. We didn't anticipate the public being aware until closer to Miami. Try again in a few days and sorry for the delay. It's Charles and let's do these in order We spent a great deal of time writing and testing PoC code and also examining the scripting language. As a cryptographer, my foremost concern is the security model behind our sandbox. There is risk in all technology, yet we are early enough in this process to change things in the event an unexpected failure of design occurs. GHOST is solid and we already have a spec for the high level language: http://wiki.ethereum.org/index.php/CLL . That said, long journey ahead. The buy in will be in the millions and the expected market cap is in the billions. And yes this is correct, the price per ether does need to grow for returns justifying the risks of investment. Supply increases linearly whereas demand during the initial few years should be non-linear as large amounts of actors enter the market and new applications are discovered. The applications in Wall Street alone are fairly remarkable and we already have two quants working on the project writing up reference financial contracts that work on Ethereum. We have a few models for how to handle founder shares. The design principles are to both incentive founders to stay attached to the project long term and also to inhibit any notion of a pump and dumb. Thus shares need to be locked for some period of time sufficiently long to prove the utility of the network itself. Second, the network needs to evolve to the point that the founders are no longer necessary for the long term health of the ecosystem just value adders. We could stagger lock outs or do a gradual release. When the fundraiser begins, there will be full disclosure how and why we decided to do this process No, one shot and done. The purpose of the 0.25x developer shares is to endow a DAC to maintain the network long term after ether has a respectable market value. The fundraiser covers expenses up to that point. There are five founders and the other 3 will be announced when the website is launched prior to Miami. We'll be front and center with PGP keys and all. There are also a lot of volunteers, developers and others we've managed to pick up over the past month.
