Pls add why   Personally I have interest in some older 'proven to be solid-' POS coins with not too high stake, it dillutes the amount of existing coins and it will be harder for the price to rise. So I decided to hold lots of CBX with only 2% max annual inflation and technically flawless. From the newer coins I got RDD's (5% annual) because it has a great niche on social media platforms, it seems nowadays everyone has some accounts so it's a big potential market, good coins to hold longterm.

17,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1082139.0,2,845,tnxgrid,"Multiple Voting in POS Cannot be Detected and It Weakens Security A POS blockchain can be less secure than POW because of multiple voting of some miners - there is a group of miners in POS that does not exist in POW, the selfish or rational miners.   Most POS system work by selecting one miner stochastically each time to sign and add one block, based the recent blockchain history, a miner’s stake data, and the current time (in seconds).  The probability a miner is selected is proportional to the stake shares of the miner (in most cases stake is the number of coins a miner owns).  In case of a fork, the branch with the most stakes is the winner, which is similar to POW in that the branch with the most hash power wins. In case of an attack, there are three groups of miners in POS.  One group is the above mentioned selfish miners.  They will vote on any braches they can to optimize reward, since it does not cost much to do so.  The two other groups are the attackers and the honest or altruistic miners.  The attacker will always vote on his own branch and the honest miners will always follow the rules to vote on just the main branch.  The breaking point is when both branches have equal amount of stakes Attacker% + Selfish Miner% = Honest Miner% + Selfish Miner%   or Attacker% = Honest Miner%   also Honest Miner% + Attacker% + Selfish Miner% = 100% These give us the stake percentage an attacker needs to control in order to succeed Attacker% = (100% - Selfish Miner%) / 2 In POW Selfish Miner% = 0, so it takes at least 50%, or majority, to attack the blockchain.  In POS, however, it all depends on the percentage of selfish miners.  It only takes 25% to attack successfully if there are 50% selfish miners.  You can argue that there will not be a high percentage of selfish miners because doing so will destroy the value of their stakes, therefore against their interest, but technically there is nothing in POS that can prevent the selfish miners from existing.  This is the essence of the so called “nothing at stake” attack.  Multiple voting by the selfish miners weakens the security of POS and turns the “51% attack” to less than 51%. There have been proposals to penalize multiple voting.  The difficulty, however, is that it is easy to multiple vote and avoid being detected.  In case of a fork, for example, a miner with a 10% of total stakes in the system has a probability of 10% to be selected on each branch.   He can sign 1 out 10 blocks on average on each branch.  As shown in Fig. 1, double voting can only be detected if the miner voted on both branches at the same block height.  This only happens with a probability of 10% x 10% = 1%.  In 200 blocks (100 each branch) a selfish miner will gets a chance to double sign 20 of them (10 on each branch) with only 1 block getting detected (overlapped in the 2 branches).  All he needs to do is to not to sign that 1 block and he still gets to sign 19 of them.  He can do even better by spreading his stakes.  For example, ten 1% stakes still get the same 10% probability of double signing 20 blocks out of 200.  The chance of being detected is now reduced to 1% x 1% x 10 = 0.1%.  The hard problem is really how to detect multiple voting, which the current POS fails. Fig. 1.  Multiple voting cannot be detected (it is not against the rules either) if a miner signs blocks in 2 branches at different heights. Pool of Stake In order to solve the POS weakness described above and also not to burn valuable resources like POW, we propose a new way of building blockchain.  Like POS intangible stake is used in our system. Miners are grouped into multiple stake pools.  A pool is formed by a leading “representative stake” and other stakes joining the pool.  The joining process is like paying one’s stake to the representative so a stake can join only one pool at a time.  Stakes have the rights to leave a pool at any time.  A pool’s stake is the sum of all the stakes joined. One pool is selected based the recent history (or take turns) to propose transactions to be included in a block.  All pools can sign the proposed transactions using their representative’s private keys to create a block.  The block with the most stakes signed is the winner in a fixed time period (like 10 minutes).  All the pools signed the winning block share the reward coins based the pool’s stake amount.  The proposing pool can get extra reward.   To control the total number of pools in the system the number of signatures is capped in one block and the pools with more stakes should be included first.  To make the stakes spread more evenly among the pools the maximum award a pool can get can be capped as well, for example, at maximum of 5% of total coins rewarded for a block.  This way a pool with 10% stake will earn the same amount of coins as a 5% stake pool.  5% will leave the pool since they can earn more reward somewhere else. A pool will be disbanded if it is caught double signing on blocks at the same height.  The representative’s stake in the pool is destroyed permanently.  Other stakes can form a new pool or join other pools. Like other systems, the blockchain with the most stakes is the consensus. Although this is not necessary, a separate cryptocurrency can be introduced into the system to represent shares of stake in the system and the reward coin can be in a different currency.  This way the miner stakes are kept stable and the reward coins can be spent without affecting the stake shares.  The total amount of stakes in the system can be capped.  Once all the stakes are distributed no more new stakes can be issued.  The number of coins rewarded for one block can be fixed forever or based on a target inflation rate. We name our new system Proof of Representation (POR).  The major differences of POR from POS include 1) Miners can join pools to form a hierarchal structure.  Only pools or stakes with enough shares get a chance to sign blocks.  2) All stakes represented by pools vote at every block height instead of just one or some miners representing minority stakes.  As a result, multiple voting can be detected in our new system.  This is crucial to the security of blockchain without burning valuable physical resources. POR has some advantages over POW as well.  For details please see http://intocrypto.com/por.pdf Thoughts?",21,Newbie,tnxgrid,04:09:20,2015-06-06,15,80,1,Pool of Stake: Improved POS to Prevent Multiple Voting

17,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1082139.0,2,845,tnxgrid,"Pool forming can be based on a few simple rules.  The goal is to limit the total number of pools and make stakes spread evenly among the pools. 1. Multiple pools can sign a block.  2. The maximum number of pool signatures a block can take is capped, for example at 20.  3. The reward coins a pool can get from one block is capped, for example at 5%.  4. The winning block is the one with the most stakes.  The miners can join pools freely and a miner gets his reward from the pool he joined.  Since each miner is after max reward, there will be 20 pools and each pool will have roughly 5% stakes at the end. With the above rules the 20 pools will sign every block in the blockchain.  In the ideal situation each block gets 100% stake voting.  To prevent double-voting, each pool can only sign only one block at the same height.  In case of a fork, a pool can sign either branch but not both.  If a pool is caught signing 2 blocks at the same height the pool owner's stake is destroyed with the 2 signatures at the same height as evidence.",27,Newbie,tnxgrid,05:51:59,2015-06-11,15,80,1,Pool of Stake: Improved POS to Prevent Multiple Voting

The miners are just taking different roles.  The system is so designed that when a pool behaves badly the interest of the joining miners will be harmed and this will drive the miners away to other pools. The purpose of pools is to detect N@S double-voting.  It is not possible to detect double-voting without major stakes in each and every block.  The total number of pools can be controlled - see the details.  I am not sure what is the optimum number of pools but 2-3 pools is definitely not decentralized enough.  The number of pools should be a balance between efficiency (network traffic and block size) and security.

That just comes across to me as anti-Microsoft FUD. Mono wasn't even developed by Microsoft. You can develop with it on Linux with MonoDevelop. You don't even have to touch a Windows machine. There are also sandboxing capabilities. And, you can even look at the code yourself if you're capable. Again, how does using it make an application *by default* less secure than you choosing to make use of *any* other framework (in other words, pick any other, and it *must* be better)? For sure, if you know of a security vulnerability in Mono that impacts MoneroX, tell the Mono guys about it.

That leads me to believe that right now XEM is still in price discovery mode (true prices can really only be known at the top of the pump and the bottom of the dump) but seems to be settling down, and that any long term pump, will actually be the real deal caused by increased demand and not somebody manipulating the market to create bag holders.  The problem with NEM right now, is the platform as a whole is still very young and doesn't really have a lot of great features that would support this increased demand.  What it does, it does better than any other coin I believe, but it is still just a coin and lots of other coins have a huge first mover advantage and the people using them find that they work well enough to not make a switch.  But NEM is a long game, and while it has a coin ""XEM"" that is not the point of the platform.  In the future hopefully NEM will have more features added other than just messaging and sending coins, at which point the demand and marketcap will go up, especially if NEM offers services that aren't found elsewhere.  And so far the NEM devs have been very good at building tech with features that haven't and can't be found elsewhere.  Right now most of these just focus only on security, which is a much needed thing in crypto, but doesn't really do a lot to boost transactions today.  But hopefully some new tech will come along that does boost transaction in the future and that creates a higher real market cap.",504,Hero Member,jabo38,07:42:41,2015-04-19,518,600,8,(XEM) NEM Speculation thread

Litecoin for many reasons imeo is the best crypto todate, not perfect but the best we have to work with, there's real reasons its maintained number 1 alt for so long. One of the few where the founder wasn't motivated by fiat, examined where all previous alts had failed and successfully created one that avoided previous faults. Coffeecoin, well its crappier then crap, however I have a few business dealings in the coffee industry and was looking to create my own coffeecoin, could work in extremely well with fair trade initiatives. a coffeecoin was created before I got mine up so I thought I could go with it........anyway not what i'd hoped so i left when others had their own plans for it (wanted to keep it as another shitcoin and wouldn't go along with a bigger more useful plan, which left me dumbfounded but what can u do).",624,Hero Member,kelsey,07:32:06,2015-03-31,812,600,2,(XEM) NEM Speculation thread

For instance, if I currently have 0.19 XMR in the wallet, and try to send 0.19 XMR, when I click the send button the address box and amount is depopulated, but nothing is sent, and nothing alerts me as to why. Also in this case, the address and amount boxes *shouldn't* be depopulated if the send doesn't occur, because most likely the user will want to change simply the amount and then try again, and not have to re-copy the address that they are sending to.",631,Legendary,mmortal03,13:49:20,2015-04-02,1092,200,20,[XMR] MoneroX - A cross platform graphical account manager for Monero

Looking at the simplewallet log, the RPC outputs for both transactions were there, but the second transaction's outputs never concluded with ""Transaction successfully sent"" -- it seems to have just become stuck before that.  I'm also not seeing any CPU activity from either simplewallet or MoneroClient. I may have to kill the processes manually, it seems. Edit: after waiting about 45 minutes, MoneroClient finally crashed with the following crash log: Code: One or more errors occurred.    at System.Threading.Tasks.Task`1.GetResultCore(Boolean waitCompletionNotification)    at Jojatekok.MoneroAPI.RpcUtilities.RpcWebClient.PostString(String host, UInt16 port, String relativeUrl, String postData)    at Jojatekok.MoneroAPI.RpcUtilities.RpcWebClient.HttpPostData[T](String host, UInt16 port, String command, JsonRpcRequest jsonRpcRequest)    at Jojatekok.MoneroAPI.RpcManagers.BaseRpcManager.HttpPostData[T](String command, JsonRpcRequest jsonRpcRequest)    at Jojatekok.MoneroAPI.RpcManagers.DaemonRpcManager.QueryNetworkInformation()    at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunInternal(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean preserveSyncCtx)    at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean preserveSyncCtx)    at System.Threading.TimerQueueTimer.CallCallback()    at System.Threading.TimerQueueTimer.Fire()    at System.Threading.TimerQueue.FireNextTimers()",670,Legendary,mmortal03,05:02:28,2015-02-11,1092,200,18,[XMR] MoneroX - A cross platform graphical account manager for Monero

I've just tried sending 3 transactions (2 with a payment ID, and one without any additional information) in a row from my client, and it seemed to be working perfectly: all of them have arrived. But after waiting for a little while, Visual Studio's debugger has notified me that the object responsible for storing the list of transactions was modified from a wrong thread (not the main one), thus, resulting in a crash. Shortly, this was just a side-effect of the migration to the separated API, but I've resolved it already. Other than that, your crash seems to be related to the RPC communication, as I've set network timeouts for RPC requests to infinite (in order not to experience crashes when trying to save the blockchain, as it takes more than 100 seconds to do so)...

461,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=683365.320,5,52881,Jojatekok,"Monero Client .NET is back with a new release! v0.39.0-rc.3 Hooray! It's time for me to present a new release of my project. I would like to dedicate it to the core development team, who have been working so hard lately that they broke all the older versions of my client. There are still many things to be improved, but at least, for people who already have an account since v0.38.1, this release will provide stability along with usefulness. I've also tried to implement account file creation, but it seems that the core team has even changed the format of accounts, thus, new account files are not compatible with my software anymore. I'll resume to the newly-appearing issues later, but let's see what was improved in 2015's first .NET client release: Started to utilize the latest stable version of bitmonerod Added indonesian translation Fixed all the shutdown-related bugs (including one which made saving the blockchain impossible) Fixed a menu localization issue Plans for the future As you may have already heard, Microsoft is making their .NET Framework's source code open for the public, thus, giving a chance for porting .NET applications to other platforms in the future. That is also a reason behind returning to the development of Monero Client .NET. I would like to announce a roadmap for those who are still curious about the next things to come. First of all, I have to tell that v0.39 releases have featured a lot of new technologies in the background. It was the first set of releases to support the ""daemonized"" bitmonerod and rpcwallet, which are still in a beta development state by the core team. That's the main reason why there wasn't a release of my client which could be labelled fully stable. As it seems to take some time to advance to these new technologies by the core team (merging them with new developments like the embedded blockchain DB or the new account seed generation mechanism) , I decided not to continue the development of v0.39 releases, but build a stable v0.40 which returns back to the usage of - the latest - simplewallet and the non-experimental version of bitmonerod . Further on, this project consists of 2 parts: one which is responsible for the communication with the background workers' RPC interfaces, and one which renders the GUI, utilizing the API subproject. My idea is to separate the 2 subprojects in order to provide .NET developers an easy way to interact with the RPC without the need of implementing JSON data decoders by self . This may even encourage more people to help in project development, and would make it easy to create robust block explorers in ASP.NET (Microsoft's web development platform). As I have already mentioned sometime before, I'm 17 years old, so I have to study now in order to acquire a great career later. I also have other programming projects to work on, but I do all these things for my own entertainment in my free time. Please bear in mind that it's not easy to keep up with these extra activities I do besides school, so developments will be slower than during the summer. Enjoy the new release, and donate some XMR to the core development team who made this project exist!",691,Sr. Member,Jojatekok,19:08:12,2015-01-12,258,200,17,[XMR] MoneroX - A cross platform graphical account manager for Monero

Also, the reason behind the slow initialization of bitmonerod is not my fault (as it is started in the background as soon as my client's GUI appears), but the core assembly's. You may also have noticed that there is a delay asking for encrypted accounts' passphrases: that's because the daemon's RPC takes that long to initialize!

461,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=683365.200,5,52881,Jojatekok,"OK, now we're making progress. I just did something similar to this, and it finally stopped it from crashing.  The important part may have been the clearing out of much of the C:\Users\UserName\Roaming\BitMonero\ directory. The crashing might have been caused by having the previous version of bitmonerod.exe in the BitMonero folder, but I'll leave that for later date to try to reproduce. The NEW problem now is, bitmonerod.exe doesn't load when running the GUI, so rpcwallet can't find the daemon to connect. To troubleshoot this, I copied bitmonerod.exe from Resources\Software into the C:\Users\UserName\Roaming\BitMonero\ directory right next to where the blockchain files are stored, and ran it manually, and it didn't even see the blockchain file, and started downloading from scratch! So, I searched my machine to find where this instance of bitmonerod.exe was actually saving the fresh blockchain files, and found two copies, one under C:\ProgramData\bitmonero\ AND one under C:\Users\All Users\bitmonero\ both with the same last modified date (these folders seem to be soft linked, so they are one and the same) To be sure, I thought that the location was supposed to be C:\Users\UserName\Roaming\BitMonero\? Is this no longer the case? Even with this knowledge in play, if I try to copy my latest blockchain.bin to one of those soft linked directories and then run bitmonerod.exe to try to have it bootstrap it, it simply ignores it there, too, and downloads from scratch, and on stop_daemon, writes right over top of it.

I've kept each GUI version in a separate folder so that I don't run into this issue; I only move the wallet folder. The initial crash happens when trying to point the wallet path setting in 39.3 to a wallet created in 38.1. When going back to 38.1, even after deleting the .config file, more crashing occurs. This may not be mutually exclusive, as the initial crash may have corrupted the poolstate.bin, causing the subsequent crashing and broken nature after reverting back to 38.1.

Please be aware that this is a test release, thus, it isn't being beamed by auto-update. You can download it from here . Disclaimer This release is experimental and should not be used in production, but for testing purposes only. It is meant to bring the core development team a bigger tester base for using the new daemon and rpcwallet. There are some known bugs in this version which are already being worked on by the core development team: You must wait for the daemon to initialize its RPC service before entering your wallet password (Wait for the synchronization status icon to appear in the main window) You cannot create a new wallet, but use an already existing one Have fun using the new build, and please give feedback about it, as it would be valuable for the entire Monero team. Changes Added support for sending bigger (split) transactions Improved stability by changing 'GET' requests' type to 'POST', as suggested in the JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification Well, I'm not sure about that, as the migration worked just fine for me back then... Please ensure that you don't enter your wallet passphrase before the daemon initializes, check whether rpcwallet.exe is running in the background after about 5 minutes, and inform me whether my software requests you to enter a password on startup. If these are not the symptoms, then try re-indexing your wallet file by deleting the '.bin', and keeping the '.bin.keys'. This can take up to 30 minutes, and after that, it automatically saves in 6 minutes.

I was happy to instruct even the worst people until now, but you seem to be pawning them all. I'm extremely sorry that my support has to end like this for you, but a customer support always works two-sided. I - as one person - am the programmer, graphical designer, tester, promoter, maintainer, and support guy of this software. As I have already told you, I receive no money for this except donations (Shout-out goes to a guy who has pledged 0.05 BTC for me, that's the biggest amount I ever got). I try to help everyone as soon as possible, even on my vacation - which ends in 10 days from now. By the way, the software you linked shows the transaction types false - if you check the original GUI bounty thread, you may see my detailed explanation of the case - that's why I'm not yet able to implement correct display for them.

Make sure that you re-index your 'wallet.bin' file by deleting it, and then opening the wallet using the '.keys' file only. Re-indexing may take up to 30 minutes as of today, and after that, you should wait for your new '.bin' file to appear in the 'WalletData' directory, so you won't have to wait so much to open your digital purse again. Also, take notice that you currently cannot determine the type of transactions, but order them by date (using the '#' column). If your wallet still doesn't contain the balance you consider to be lost, try sending your latest transaction ID to the support. Please share your experiences with us, providing the most information you can, as any special case matters for me as being the developer of this client.",920,Sr. Member,Jojatekok,12:46:10,2014-08-02,258,200,6,[XMR] MoneroX - A cross platform graphical account manager for Monero

If you are afraid of your wallet files being compromised, you can check the project's source code here , compile it by yourself, and disable automatic updates by setting the '-noupdate' flag for 'MoneroClient.Net.exe'. In most of the cases (whenever people try to set the TX fee below 0.005 XMR [which I have disabled in the current release]) , re-indexing the wallet file solves all the issues.

This release is experimental and should not be used in production, but for testing purposes only. It is meant to bring the core development team a bigger tester base for using the new daemon and rpcwallet which offer a lot more opportunities (like using Windows services) waiting besides my current implementation. Also, I have set the client to request administrator mode on startup to avoid issues accessing the registry, and allow more developments to be done in the future. There are some known bugs in this version which are already being worked on by the core development team: You must wait for the daemon to initialize its RPC service before entering your wallet password (Wait for the synchronization status icon to appear in the main window) You cannot create a new wallet, but use an already existing one Have fun using the new build, and please give feedback about it, as it would be valuable for the entire Monero team.

The main problem is with getting the wallet sync state file (wallet.bin) up to date - MoneroClient cant spend more than about 5 minutes trying to sync a wallet without crashing when the daemon decides to save (this is more a problem with bitmonerod/simplewallet rather than MoneroClient). Solution is to create the wallet.bin file from the CLI, which shouldnt be too challenging if you were using it with your old wallet anyway So, these are  the steps I followed: Backup your existing MoneroClient wallet, then close the app and make sure bitmonerod process has stopped Browse to where MoneroClient files are, and delete any wallet files from the ""WalletData"" folder Copy your old wallet.bin.keys file which you wish to import into the ""WalletData"" folder, if its not already called ""wallet.bin.keys"" then rename it In the MoneroClient folder next browse to ""Resources/Software"" and run bitmonerod.exe by dbl-clicking it, wait until it has synced the blockchain Now dbl-click ""simplewallet.exe"" to run that, and when prompted enter the path to your wallet as MoneroClient path/ WalletData/wallet.bin Simplewallet will find your .keys file and start scanning the blockchain to recreate your wallet, this could take some time but when it has finished make sure you type ""save"", then ""exit"" Type ""exit"" in your bitmonerod window as well to close that properly Now when you run MoneroClient it will find your imported wallet and its up to date sync state file, so should show the correct balance after a short while, now its ready to use! You can import multiple old wallets this way, just make sure to use the MoneroClient ""Backup Manager"" to save each one before doing the next, and you can also use the Backup Manager to restore the wallet when you need it. Bear in mind that if you leave a wallet for too long without checking it in MoneroClient it may have to be manually CLI resynced again (although you dont have to delete the wallet.bin on subsequent runs). One other thing I encountered you should watch out for, if your imported wallet has a lot of ""dust"" imports from mining in the past before the pools updated their payment systems, you may find that sending more than a few XMR in one transaction causes the MoneroClient to hang. Currently it doesnt seem to be able to trap the ""transaction too large"" error from SimpleWallet, hopefully that will be resolved soon.",976,Sr. Member,RentaMouse,02:25:58,2014-07-14,252,200,3,[XMR] MoneroX - A cross platform graphical account manager for Monero

EDIT #1: You don't need to answer these questions, I probably know the reason: The information-querying timers are disposed after killing the daemon (and wallet) process, thus, causing a crash when they are executed after the processes have been closed. EDIT #2: Also, when I switched to using the RPC version of simplewallet, I didn't realize that it does not support the 'exit' command (for safe shutdown), so the next release will contain a fix for this, too. Right, I wouldn't be asking for donations if it did so. You can check the source code , and even compile it for yourself if you wanted to be extra careful.",990,Sr. Member,Jojatekok,08:08:42,2014-07-11,258,200,2,[XMR] MoneroX - A cross platform graphical account manager for Monero

From the next version, '.keys' files will automatically be identified, but - as discussed on IRC before with the devs - simplewallet's RPC is not yet capable of restoring those wallets because of the deamon being busy while refreshing. This issue may persist until the daemon's development team does not switch to use rocksDB for storing the blockchain. Until then, you can restore your wallet from the '.keys' file using command line: First, make sure that your 'wallet.bin' and 'wallet.bin.keys' files are backed up, and then the '.bin' file is removed from the directory which contains the keys for your wallet Open 'bitmonerod.exe', and then 'simplewallet.exe' In the wallet terminal, select the desired file (probably 'wallet.bin' [even if it doesn't exist] ), and then enter the passphrase for it Input ""refresh"", and then hit enter Execute the ""save"" command",997,Sr. Member,Jojatekok,15:28:12,2014-07-11,258,200,2,[XMR] MoneroX - A cross platform graphical account manager for Monero
