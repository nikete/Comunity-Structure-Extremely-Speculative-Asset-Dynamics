\section{Literature}
This work is at the intersection of three literatures: in economics and finance on the study of speculative bubbles, in network science on the prediction of outcomes based on features of an individual in a network, and in computer science, largely centered on the security community, studying cryptocurrencies.
We provide pointers to the literature in the first and last, while refer readers to the textbook \cite{KleinbergNetworks} for the predictive power of network features. 

Perhaps the most striking line of research on bubbles in economics with respect to cryptocurrencies is the study of markets where the asset is worthless and this is common knowledge. 
Recently \cite{moinas2013bubble} studies both theoretically and experimentally in the laboratory such a bubble. 
The driving force is that some traders ``do not know where they stand in the market sequence, the game allows for
a bubble at the Nash equilibrium when there is no cap on the maximum price.''.
In the context of cryptocurrencies the lack of knowledge around the sequence position maps to uncertainty about ones place in the technology adoption knowledge and adoption curve, while the difficulty in upper bounding the potential market value of cryptocurrencies provides the lack of cap on the maximum price. 
A large literature in finance empirically examines herding by financial analysts, for a recent example\cite{jegadeesh2009analysts} tests the hypothesis of herding in analysts forecasts. 
In  \cite{clement2005financial} the properties of analysts who disagree with their peers and of their forecasts, they find bold forecasterss better incorporate analysts' private information and offer more relevant information to investors than herding forecasters.
While extensive this literature offers little guidance in that 

Several academics papers have recently appeard proposing cryptocoins or potential algorithms around bitcoin to produce better properties, see for example \cite{bonneau2014mixcoin}.
A fascinating line of work \cite{meiklejohn2013fistful, soska2015measuring} seeks to understand what bitcoins are used for, both via reidentification attacks and by scrapping the marketplaces that they are used in.
