\section{Literature}

This work is at the intersection of three literatures: economics on the study of speculative bubbles, network science on the prediction of outcomes based on features of an individual in a network, and a nacent field in the computer science security comunity that studies cryptocurrencies.


\subsection{Bubbles}

Perhaps the most striking line of research on bubbles in economics with respect to the cryptocurrency market is the study of those where the asset is worthless and this is common knowledge. 

In \cite{} " a bubble game that involves sequential trading of an
asset commonly known to be valueless. Because some traders do not
know where they stand in the market sequence, the game allows for
a bubble at the Nash equilibrium when there is no cap on the maximum
price. We run experiments both with and without a price cap.
Structural estimation of behavioral game theory models suggests that
quantal responses, uncertainty regarding other traders’ rationality,
and analogy-based expectations are important drivers of speculation. "


Decision-rule cascades and the dynamics of speculative bubbles
We combine Minsky’s Wnancial fragility analysis, behavioural analysis of decision rules and the
evolutionary economics of rule trajectories to provide an empirically grounded and computationally
tractable theory of the complex evolutionary dynamics of speculative Wnancial upswings. The behavioural
dynamics of asset bubbles can be conceptualized as the joint consequence of the adoption and
diVusion process of new investment decision rules coupled with the degradation of those rules as they
pass from a few expert investors to larger population of amateurs. We illustrate this using data covering
the recent Brisbane property market bubble (1999–2003) and show how it is consistent with the
existence of such cascading decision rules. We then explain how multi-agent simulation methods can
be used for modelling decision rule cascades.

\subsection{Prediction from networks}

"The Structural Virality of Online Diffusion" (Management Science)




"Here we propose a formal measure of what we label “structural virality” that interpolates between two conceptual extremes: content that gains its popularity through a single, large broadcast, and that which grows through multiple generations with any one individual directly responsible for only a fraction of the total adoption"

"We find that across all domains and all sizes of events, online diffusion is characterized by surprising structural diversity. Popular events, that is, regularly grow via both broadcast and viral mechanisms, as well as essentially all conceivable combinations of the two."

"we find that the correlation between the size of an event and its structural virality is surprisingly low, meaning that knowing how popular a piece of content is tells one little about how it spread"

"We find that while several of our empirical findings are consistent with such a model, it does not replicate the observed diversity of structural virality"











Network Diversity and Economic Development

"Hence, highly clustered, or insular, social ties are predicted to limit access to social and economic prospects from outside the social group, whereas heterogeneous social ties may generate these opportunities from a range of diverse contacts (1, 2)."

"Although both social and spatial network diversity scores were strongly correlated with IMD rank, we found a weaker positive correlation present using number of contacts and a negative correlation for communication volume."

"For example, whereas inhabitants of Stoke-on-Trent, one of the least prosperous regions in the UK, averaged a higher monthly call volume than the national average, they have one of the lowest diversity scores in the country. Similarly prosperous Stratford-upon-Avon has inhabitants with extremely diverse networks, despite no more communication than the national average. "

Social behavior can be used to predict spending behavior in couples in regards to their prepensity to diversify the businesses they explore, become loyal customers and overspend. The results show that mobile phone social interaction patters can be more predictive than personality based features when predicting spending behavior. 

"We find that social behavior measured via face-to-face interaction, call, and SMS logs, can be used to predict the spending behavior for couples in terms of their propensity to explore diverse businesses, become loyal customers, and overspend"

"results show that mobile phone based social interaction patterns can provide more predictive power on spending behavior than personality based features. Interestingly, we find that more social couples also tend to overspend."




Money Walks: Implicit Mobility Behavior and Financial Well-Being:

Spatiotemporal traits such as exploration, engagement and elasticity can be used to predict future finanical difficulties. 

"Hence, in this work we study a large-scale cross-sectional dataset of human spending across space and time, and connect it to the biological phenomena of “foraging,” a basic pattern of animal movement to gather foods and resources."

"we analyzed a corpus of hundreds of thousands of human economic transactions and found that financial outcomes for individuals are intricately linked with their spatiotemporal traits like exploration, engagement, and elasticity. Such features yield models that are 30\% to 49\% better at predicting future financial difficulties than the comparable demographic models."

"As shown in Fig 2, individuals with lower levels of education (High School, Middle School, or Primary School) were found to be more likely to be late for their payments and get into financial trouble. Users with higher age were marginally less likely to overspend, miss payments, or get into financial trouble. Last, male customers and married customers were less likely to miss their payments."

"The figure also shows that multiple mobility behavior features were statistically correlated with outcome variables, even after controlling for the effect of abovementioned demographic variables of age, gender, marital status, education, and work type."

"the behavioral features were found to be more significantly associated (in terms of p-values) and contain higher predictive power (in terms of odds ratios being further away from 1.0 in either direction) as compared to the demographic features."

"The evidence so far indicating that each of the spatio-temporal behavioral descriptors has significant association with different financial outcomes motivates their combination to predict the financial outcome"

"Using a set of novel psychology-informed indicators that can be computed from data available to all carriers, we were able to predict users’ personality with a mean accuracy across traits of 42% better than random, reaching up to 61% accuracy on a three-class problem."

"The goal of the present research is to show that users’ personalities can be reliably inferred from basic information accessible from all mobile phones and to all service providers."


"The model predicted whether phone users were low, average, or high in neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness with an accuracy of 54%, 61%, 51%, 51%, and 49%, respectively."
