The total variance accounted for is small, so you need a discussion like "results suggest that bubble dynamics may be strongly influenced by a core set of participants, but that traditional network measures on the aggregate discussion graph do not provide a tight characterization of this core group.  We are looking at coarse (positive/negative, detailed/cursory) semantic analysis of the discussion, and evidence of prior cooperation between pairs of participants in other altcoin markets, in order to attempt this more accurate characterization of core participants and their actions.
