\subsection{Nontrivial coins}

Many of the coins available in the exchanges are trivial modifications of another coin in that they only change parameters such as the name, the number of total mineable coins, or the transaction time between blocks.
These coins production cost is virtualy zero\footnote{ there is a substantial amount of resources from pay per use services that provide ready binaries, to open source starter packs such as cryptonotestarter.org}.

To attempt to capture this we analize data from mapofcoins.com which includes a genealogy of coins.
If the coin to be analyzed has a parent and the algorithm it uses differs from the parent, that is labeled as nontrivial, meaning that the coin implemented something the parent doesn't have and is not like other coins, a direct fork with only parameters changed, such as total mineable coins, transaction speed, etc.
