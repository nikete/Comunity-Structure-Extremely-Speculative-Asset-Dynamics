Our daily price and volume data are scraped from \url{http://coinmarketcap.com}, which is the most exhaustive data source on all cryptocoins. The site contains the historical data for 660 cryptocoins, each starting at the earliest date the coin appeared in an exchange. We were able to match \textcolor{376} (out of 660) the coins to their introducers in the forums. The price and volume data are aggregated over 77 exchanges which span across several countries. Nevertheless, only a few exchanges such as Bitfinex, BTC-E, Poloniex and Cryptsy carry the bulk of the market volume.
