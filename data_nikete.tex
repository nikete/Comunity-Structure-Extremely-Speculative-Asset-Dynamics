Our daily price and volume data are scraped from \url{http://coinmarketcap.com}, which is the most exhaustive data source on all cryptocoins.

The site contains the historical data for 674 cryptocoins, each starting at the earliest date the coin appeared in an exchange.  The price and volume data are aggregated daily over 77 exchanges which span across several countries (the majority of activity originates from the US). Nevertheless, only a few exchanges such as Bitfinex, BTC-E, Poloniex and Cryptsy carry the bulk of the market volume. We were able to match 626 (out of 674) coins to the users who introduce them for the first time in the forums.
