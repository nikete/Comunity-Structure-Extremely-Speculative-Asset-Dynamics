Our main outcome measures are the severity of drop in the value of a unit of the asset, and the magnitude in USD of the transactions in it.
We scrape daily price and volume data from coinmarketcap.com\footnote{ For robustness analysis smaller subsets of the coins where available from coin }
We operationalize the severity of a bubble as the inverse of a 1 dollar that would be lost buying at the maximum price and selling after that proportionally to the volume of the market till the present, we call this severity.
We define the volume as the sum of the dollar volume of trade reported over all exchanges.
