\section{Analysis Variables}
\subsection{Prices and Exchanges}
Our main outcome measures are the severity of the inflation of an asset's price, and the magnitude of money transacted in it.
We operationalize the intensity of a bubble as the proportion of a 1 dollar (TODO check currency base) that would be lost buying at the maximum price and selling after that proportionally to the volume of the market till the present, we call this severity.
%JULIAN: Wasn't this defined previously? Needs an equation!
We define the volume as the sum of the contemporaneous dollar (todo check) volume of trade.
As a secondary outcome measure we consider the number of exchanges that list the coin.
