\caption{The log of bubble severity (left) and bubble magnitude (right) vs. introducer closeness centrality per trivial and nontrivial coins. Centrality of asset introducer has a stronger relationship with bubble severity than its magnitude in the case of trivial coins, while this relationship is the opposite in the case of coins with actual technological innovations.}

Speculative bubbles are perceived to periodically take over markets \cite{garber2001famous}.
Going back at least to the \emph{South Sea} bubble in the early 18\textsuperscript{th} century, well-informed parties  have invested knowingly in bubbles, and found it profitable \cite{temin2004riding}.
Today, the public notoriety of Bitcoin, together with its massive price increases and their associated publicity lead to an explosion of attempts to create ``the next Bitcoin''.
Collectively, these currencies are often referred to as ``cryptocurrencies'' or ``cryptocoins'' or simply ``coins'', and a vibrant set of exchanges have emerged where these are traded, either for each other or money.
The majority of these coins have no possible future value in the long term, and their markets would appear to be driven largely by speculation.
Many of them appear to be nothing but attempts at turning a quick profit from inflating the implied valuation of a coin shortly after creating it.
This is driven by the extremely low cost and effort required to create a new coin, with most being minimal changes to parameters and branding of a pre-existing codebase.

Those who make and trade these coins communicate largely online, and much of their activity is concentrated on public forums. 
Moreover, price and volume data from the exchanges is freely available and widely aggregated\footnote{Exchanges are however largely unregulated, often anonymous, and there is no way to account how much of reported volumes are manipulation attempts. The existence of attempts at arbitrage between them places some bounds on how blatantly the data can be manipulated for prices, but volumes are impossible to assess. },

. This makes cryptocoins
%JULIAN: cryptocoins is a new work--maybe avoid mixing the terms
an ideal lens through which to study the social life of a ``market mania'' \cite{cosma2008}.
Such a study is valuable both as a means of understanding the dynamics of bubbles themselves, but also from a computational social science perspective, to understand the ecosystem and lifecycles of these online communities.
%Such a study can serve in the computational social sciences a role analogous to that of lesion studies do in neuropsychology.
%JULIAN: Not obvious to me what the above analogy is without further explanation.

We present a study of a large number of cryptocurrency ecosystems, 
using a novel dataset that combines measures derived from social networks of users interacting in online cryptocurrency forums, market data aggregated over dozens of exchanges, and properties of the software implementing the cryptocurrencies themselves.
From forums, we identify the users who introduce each coin to the community and build measures of their structural position in the network based on
their engagement patterns in forum threads \emph{before} the coin is ever traded (usually within a few days after their announcement on the forum).
In this way, we identify \textcolor{red}{376} coins that are announced by users of the forum and can be mapped to price and volume data from the exchanges.
Next, from price and transaction volume data, we build measures of speculation that quantify the size of the bubble resulting from trading activity on each coin. 
We also assess if coins possibly embody technological innovation based on having more than trivial modifications to the source code of previously existing coins.

While the mechanisms that drive bubbles have been studied both theoretically

and experimentally
\cite{moinas2013bubble},
% in the lab, 
studying the social networks of those promoting the asset has not been previously possible due to the lack of an exhaustive dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to analyze the role that the global structural features of the communication network, such as the position of certain stakeholders, can play in promoting the asset.
While the magnitude of the assets traded in our study is small relative to most financial and commodity markets, it is nevertheless much larger than
%JULIAN: Found this sentence a bit funny, not that I could improve upon it
any plausible experiment in an academic environment.
For example, the largest bubble in our dataset, AuroraCoin, reached a valuation of one billion USD in March 2014,
with reported daily trading volumes of 6.8M USD. It shed 90\% and 99\% of its value in a week and well under a year, repectively.
To provide some context, this is equivalent to one quarter of Iceland's entire foreign exchange reserves in 2014 \footnote{4.1 Billon USD, The World Bank, Global Economic Monitor, accessed October 2015}, the population of which AuroraCoin promoters claimed they would distribute half of the coins to.

Using price and volume data, we construct measures of both the \textbf{magnitude} and the \textbf{severity} of bubbles.
These are defined formally in our variable section \ref{variables_nikete},
but their intuition is that we say the magnitude of a bubble is large when a high volume of trades measured in dollars happens,
%JULIAN: Does it make a difference what it's measured in?
while a coin has a severe bubble if investing a fixed amount leads to losing a large proportion. 
By considering the community structure that exists in the forum before a coin is introduced, we are able to predict a substantial fraction of the variation in both the severity and magnitude of the resulting bubble.
This is a challenging task as models that rely on either simple activity or network metrics show almost no predictive out-of-sample power, and are unable to explain even 1\% of the variation in either tasks,
while our best model performs an order of magnitude better in both tasks.
%JULIAN: R^2 of 0.1 (if I interpret correctly) doesn't sound impressive until you've argued the fundamental difficulty of the problem, you might wait to mention such numbers.
%JULIAN: Would sound more impressive if you just said "it performs an order of magnitude better"
The main driver of our explanatory power is the centrality of users in the directed communication network derived from the forum. 
Both the severity and the magnitude of bubbles increases with the centrality of the user who introduces a new coin to the community.
%JULIAN: Above sentence is tough to parse, but kind of an important one.

%EAMAN: commented out. repetion of what is said below.
%This effect appears to be mediated by whether a coin involves a nontrivial technological innovation, the direction of the interaction reversing depending on whether it relates to magnitude or severity.
Interestingly this effect is concentrated in different ways depending on whether the coin software is more than a trivial modification to existing code base: as shown in Figure \ref{volume_severity_centrality} trivial coins have more severe bubbles the more central their introducers are, while volume is greater the more central the introducer of a nontrivial coin is.

%Methodologically the free parameters in the way we do the weights on the weighted graph  is horrible, a million free parameters get introduced. follow up work for another paper: do some unsupervised feature learning over the dam forums threads to build the network; use some internal validity metric . Find political way of saying this in future work.
