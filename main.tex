\begin{abstract}

We study the power of structural features of the social network around cryptocurrencies to understand the severity of bubbles that occur in them. Our goal is to see whether bubbles in cryptocurrency markets can be predicted purely from structural features derived from the social networks that preceed them. All our measures are constructed on the social network before the relevant cryptocurrency is ever traded.
