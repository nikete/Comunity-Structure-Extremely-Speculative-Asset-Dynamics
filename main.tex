\begin{abstract}

We study the power of structural features of the social network around cryptocurrencies to understand the severity and magnitude of bubbles. 
We introduce a novel dataset that combines measures of the social network surrounding the introduction of coins in online cryptocurrency forums, the trading  behavior across marketplaces, and the presence of nontrivial changes to the source code in relation to previous coins.
Our network are constructed based on the intensity of social interactions in the forums and all the structural features of the network are measured based on the state of the social network before the relevant cryptocurrency is ever traded.
Our study reveals that structural features of the network and the nature of the source code changes achieve substantial predictive power on the severity of trading price bubbles
