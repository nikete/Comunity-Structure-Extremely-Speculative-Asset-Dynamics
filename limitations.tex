\subsection{Limitations \& Future Work}

The features of the node in the graph we use as well as the construction of the graph, while informed by the literature and theory, could be substantially improved.
We could attempt to learn the features from a more raw version of the forums, or at least learn the parametrization of our constructor, or some larger space of weighted, or potentially labeled edges with the language used.
The cross sectional design with time separation does not allow us to take advantage of intra-coin variation.

Beyond the forums the code repositories could be exploited in future work as a rich source of variation.
