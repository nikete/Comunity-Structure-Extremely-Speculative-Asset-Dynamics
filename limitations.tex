\subsection{Limitations \& Future Work}

The features of the node in the graph we use as well as the construction ofthe graph, while informed by the literature and theory, could be substantially imporoved.
We could attempt to learn the features from a more raw version of the forums, or at least learnthe parametrization of our constructor, or some larger space of weighted, or potentially labeled edges with the language used.
The cross sectional design with time separation does not allow us to take advantage of intra-coin variaiton.

Beyond the forums the code repositories could be epxloited in futre work as a rich source of variation.
