\section{Data Description}



\subsection{Prices and Exchanges}

Our main outcome measures are the severity of the inflation an asset price, and the magnitude of money transacted in it.
We operationalize the intensity of a bubble as the proportion of a 1 dollar (TODO check currency base) that would be lost buying at the maximum price and selling after that proportionally to the volume of the market till the present, we call this severity.
We define the volume as the sum of the contemporaneous dollar (todo check) volume of trade.
As a secondary outcome measure we consider the number of exchanges that list the coin.
We scraped two major price aggregators; coinmarketcap and coininfo.


\subsection{Forum Discussions}
TODO: EAMAN WILL WRITE THIS

In order to study the effect of communication network around cryptocoins on
price variations, we collected all the posts from the most famous cryptocurrency
online community, bitcointalk.  Our data consisted of all the posts that were
made between January 2010 and July 2015 on the most acitve crypto-related forums:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{Bitcoin Discussion} This is the oldest forum on the website which mainly focuses
    on issues only related to bitcoin. Interestingly, Satoshi Nakamoto, the alleged
    creator of Bitcoin made the first post on this forum in January 2010 and
    was active until January 2011. The presence of Satoshi in the data set enables us
    to study the position of various actors in the online community relative to Satoshi
    and its relation with the success or failure of cryptocoins they advocate or reject.

  \item{Altcoin Discussion} This is the most active forum in the community
    with more than 730000 posts as of July 2015, and dating back to June 2011.
    The discussions in this forum mainly evolve around alternative currencies
    other than Bitcoin. Users often discuss the merits or flaws of various
    altcoins or simply exchange technical information.
  
  \item{Announcement (Altcoin)} Community announcements such as development of 
    exchange client or addition of new features are made here. This is an important forum
    in our study as the creation of new altcoins are announced here. Whenever a new
    altcoin is announced to the community, the announcement is tagged with string ANN.
    This enables us to detect announcement of new coins into the market and identify
    the users who introduced them for the first time.

  \item{Mining (Altcoin)} Technical issues pertaining to mining (i.e. validating transactions)
    altcoins are discussed here.
  \item{Marketplace (Altcoin)} This forum contains the discussions on a wide-range of 
    market-related issues, such as price or volume trends, possible pump and dump schemes
    and exchange tips.

\end{enumerate}

TODO: discuss structure of each forum
TODO: SOME preliminary statistics on forum? ave num posts per thread?
TODO: NUMBER OF UNIQUE USERS IN THE COMMUNITY
TODO: HOW MANY ARE ACITVE IN A 30 DAY PERIOD?

Our network measurement data consisted of discussions in Bitcoin and Altcoin
online forums on bitcointalk.org from January 2010 until July 2014.  Bitcoin
forum is mainly concerned with Bitcoin and related technological issues whereas
Altcoin discussions are concerned about alternative cryptocurrencies. Each
forum consists of hundreds of threads and each thread contains many posts.
Given the forum discussion data at the level of individual posts, we
constructed the undirected graph of user discussions. In this network, nodes
are the forum users and are connected by an edge if the corresponding users
have ever interacted in any thread. The edge weights between two users are
determined based on their interaction frequency. Furthermore, the weights are
adjusted by size of the thread (i.e. an interaction in small threads counts
more than an interaction in a large thread) and a decay factor (i.e. a recent
interaction counts more than an old interaction).

We construct the network over time by replaying the posts and updating the
discussion graph accordingly.  Whenever a new digital currency was introduced
in the forum for the first time, a snapshot of the graph was taken and used for
extracting various network measures corresponding to the coin. It is important
to analyze the discussion graph before the coin is mentioned for the first time
to avoid any possible confounding factors. The network measures we used were as
followed: number of edges, number of nodes, density, diameter, clustering
coefficient, average path length and average degree. We also computed the
following network measures for the user who introduced the crypto coin for the
first time: clustering coefficient, closeness centrality, betweenness
centrality and laplacian centrality.
