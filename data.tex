\section{Data Description}

\subsection{Cryptocoin Exchanges}
We scraped two major price aggregators; coinmarketcap and coininfo.

\subsection{Forum Discussions}
TODO: EAMAN WILL WRITE THIS

Our network measurement data consisted of discussions in Bitcoin and Altcoin online forums on bitcointalk.org from January 2010 until July 2014. 
Bitcoin forum is mainly concerned with Bitcoin and related technological issues whereas Altcoin discussions are concerned about alternative cryptocurrencies. Each forum consists of hundreds of threads and each thread contains many posts.  Given the forum discussion data at the level of individual posts, we constructed the undirected graph of user discussions. In this network, nodes are the forum users and are connected by an edge if the corresponding users have ever interacted in any thread. The edge weights between two users are determined based on their interaction frequency. Furthermore, the weights are adjusted by size of the thread (i.e. an interaction in small threads counts more than an interaction in a large thread) and a decay factor (i.e. a recent interaction counts more than an old interaction).

We construct the network over time by replaying the posts and updating the discussion graph accordingly.  Whenever a new digital currency was introduced in the forum for the first time, a snapshot of the graph was taken and used for extracting various network measures corresponding to the coin. It is important to analyze the discussion graph before the coin is mentioned for the first time to avoid any possible confounding factors. The network measures we used were as followed: number of edges, number of nodes, density, diameter, clustering coefficient, average path length and average degree. We also computed the following network measures for the user who introduced the crypto coin for the first time: clustering coefficient, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and laplacian centrality.

\section{Analysis Variables}
\subsection{Prices and Exchanges}
Our main outcome measures are the severity of the inflation an asset price, and the magnitude of money transacted in it.
We operationalize the intensity of a bubble as the proportion of a 1 dollar (TODO check currency base) that would be lost buying at the maximum price and selling after that proportionally to the volume of the market till the present, we call this severity.
We define the volume as the sum of the contemporaneous dollar (todo check) volume of trade.
As a secondary outcome measure we consider the number of exchanges that list the coin.
