\section{Data \& Measures}



\subsection{Prices and Exchanges}

Our main outcome measures are the severity or intensity of how inflated an assset price was and the magnitude of the reuslting bubble. 
We operationalize the  intensity of a bubble as the proportion of a 1 dollar (todo check currency base) 
the severity of the bubble in terms of the price drop from its maximum to the present, the volume of the asset notionally traded, and the number of main exchanges that list the asset.
We scrappe two major price aggregators; coinmarketcap and coininfo ..
