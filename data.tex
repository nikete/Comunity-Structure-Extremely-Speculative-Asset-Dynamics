\section{Data \& Measures}



\subsection{Prices and Exchanges}

Our main outcome measures are the severity of the inflation an asset price, and the magnitude of money transacted in it.
We operationalize the intensity of a bubble as the proportion of a 1 dollar (TODO check currency base) that would be lost buying at the maximum price and selling after that proportionally to the volume of the market till the present, we call this severity.
We define the volume as the sum of the contemporaneous dollar (todo check) volume of trade.
As a secondary outcome measure we consider the number of exchanges that list the coin.
We scraped two major price aggregators; coinmarketcap and coininfo.


\subsection{Forum discussions}


Our network measurement data consisted of discussions in Bitcoin and Altcoin online forums on bitcointalk.org from January 2010 until July 2014. 
Bitcoin forum is mainly concerned with Bitcoin and related technological issues whereas Altcoin discussions are concerned about alternative cryptocurrencies. Each forum consists of hundreds of threads and each thread contains many posts.  Given the forum discussion data at the level of individual posts, we constructed the undirected graph of user discussions. In this network, nodes are the forum users and are connected by an edge if the corresponding users have ever interacted in any thread. The edge weights between two users are determined based on their interaction frequency. Furthermore, the weights are adjusted by size of the thread (i.e. an interaction in small threads counts more than an interaction in a large thread) and a decay factor (i.e. a recent interaction counts more than an old interaction).
