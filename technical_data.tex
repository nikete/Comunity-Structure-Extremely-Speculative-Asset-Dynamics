\section{Technical Data}
To build the technicality metric we took every coin in mapofcoins.com and ran it through this algorithm: if the coin to be analyzed has a parent and the algorithm it uses differs from the parent, that coin is said to have a technicality score of True, meaning that the coin implemented something the parent doesn't have and is not like other coins, a direct fork with only parameters changed, such as total mineable coins, transaction speed, etc.
