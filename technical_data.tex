\section{Technical Data}
To build the technicality metric we took every coin in mapofcoins.com and ran it through this algorithm: if the coin to be analyzed has a parent and the algorithm it uses differs from the parent, or if there's no parent then that coin is said to have a technicality score of True, meaning that the coin implemented something the parent doesn't have, or it's a whole new coin. If none of this conditions apply then it has a technicality score of False, meaning it's a direct fork of another coin, that only changes some parameters around, like total supply, reward, transaction time, etc
