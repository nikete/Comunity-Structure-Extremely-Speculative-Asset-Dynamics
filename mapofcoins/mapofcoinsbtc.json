Building upon the notion that money is any object, or any sort of record, accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context, Bitcoin is designed around the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than relying on central authorities. In 2009, the first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in a cryptography mailing list by a member under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto.Towards the end of 2010 Satoshi left the project, saying he had moved on to other things. However since 2010, the Bitcoin community has grown a lot. And there is no wonder: Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.","algo":"SHA-256d","name":"BTC","children":[{"Name":"Namecoin","Abbreviation":"NMC","Announce":"15\/04\/2011","Genesis":"19\/04\/2011","ForkedFrom":"BTC","Status":"Running","PoW":"SHA-256d","PoS":"no","P2P":null,"RPC":null,"BlockTime":"600","Reward":"50","HalfingCycle":null,"Total":"21000000","Premine":null,"DifficultyCycle":"2016","TxsConfirm":6,"MintConfirm":120,"ANN":null,"Code":"https:\/\/github.com\/namecoin-qt\/namecoin-qt","Site":"http:\/\/namecoin.info\/","algo":"SHA-256d","name":"NMC"},{"Name":"iXcoin","Abbreviation":"IXC","Announce":"10\/08\/2011","Genesis":null,"ForkedFrom":"BTC","Status":"Running","PoW":"SHA-256d","PoS":"no","P2P":8337,"RPC":8338,"BlockTime":"600","Reward":96,"HalfingCycle":null,"Total":21000000,"Premine":580000,"DifficultyCycle":"2016","TxsConfirm":6,"MintConfirm":120,"ANN":"https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=36218.0","Code":"https:\/\/github.com\/ixcoin\/ixcoin\/tree\/Branch_v0.3.24","Site":"http:\/\/ixcoin.org\/","Info":"iXcoin is a fork of Bitcoin with twice the inflation rate of 96 iXcoins per block and the same 21 million total limit.

Devcoins provide an income for anyone who wants to work, even if they live in an area with more job seekers than jobs. 90% of Devcoin generation goes to open source projects with bounties for accomplishments and regular payments for active developers. By buying Devcoins, you help fund developers and give the world more open source software, books, music, art, and movies. Bounties are funded based on market capitalization. When the market capitalization of Devcoin reaches a certain point, a massive bounty will be offered for the development of an open source one seater spacecraft which can exit and enter the Earth's atmosphere.","algo":"SHA-256d","name":"DVC","children":[{"Name":"Stories","Abbreviation":"STY","Announce":"06\/02\/2014","Genesis":"06\/02\/2014","ForkedFrom":"DVC","Status":"Dead","PoW":"SHA-256d","PoS":"no","P2P":null,"RPC":null,"BlockTime":"120","Reward":3000,"HalfingCycle":10000,"Total":60000000,"Premine":null,"DifficultyCycle":"360","TxsConfirm":6,"MintConfirm":null,"ANN":"https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=451343.0","Code":"https:\/\/github.com\/CryptoStories\/Stories","Site":"http:\/\/www.cryptostories.org\/","Info":"Stories aims to create an ecosystem where users can submit their favourite and most entertaining links and receive compensation by a community that enjoys good entertainment.

Freicoin's parameters are carefully chosen to eliminate the basic interest component of investments, called the liquidity premium by economists.

These blocks are a reward to the worshipper for sacrifice made. During the third and fourth weeks of the ritual the rewards build, small at first, then larger as the worship increases with fervor. During the last five days, the 'Tharanak shagg,' or 'promise of dreamland', the ritual reaches final pitch and the daily special blocks are highly increased. Finally Cthulhu will return after the 50665th offering has paid tribute to the Great Old One and he will bestow a bounty deserving of Him upon one lucky worshiper.
