Linear models show small out of sample performance gain. 
White 1980 heteroskedasticity robust standard errors as well as the selection by the cross validated ElasticNet point to a coin being technical and the centrality of the introducer as strong effects in determining the volume that is traded.

A nonlinear model shows an order of magnitude better out of sample performance using the same variables.
